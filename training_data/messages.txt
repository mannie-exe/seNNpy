Pitter patter,
The raindrops shimmer across the surface.
Cold, so cold,
It's snowing on Mt. Fuji.
Oh this is quite neat.
What a wonderful channel.
This is a haiku
Waiting patiently,
 surrounded by monkeys,
I want to go home
College
All are but monkeys,
In the clothing of a saint,
And each saint a monkey,
In the clothing of itself.
Shimmering souls sailing towards the sunset
Dancing dreams drooling on their desks
Telling tales of life's troubles
Where is my professor
I wanna hear a poem
I wanna learn something I didn‚Äôt know
I wanna say "yes" at the end, because I'm sick of saying "so?"

I wanna hear a poem about who you are
And what you think
And why you slam
Not a poem about me and my poem
Because I know who I am

I wanna hear a love poem
A sad poem
An "I hate my dad" poem
A dream poem
An "I'm not what I seem" poem
An "I need" poem
An "I also bleed" poem
An "I'm alone" poem
An "I can't find my home" poem
I just wanna hear a poem

I wanna hear a poem about revolution
About fists raised high
And hips twisting in a rumble like a rumba
I wanna follow the footsteps of Ch√®
And hear the truth about the day the CIA killed Lumumba

I wanna hear a poem about struggle
So that when I open my mouth, I can step outside myself
I wanna listen to no less than the sounds of protest
In the factories where workers sweat and make Air Jordans and Pro-Keds because
If you wanna take shots at people
Target Phil Knight and Bill Gates
Contemplate how
They own the products
And they got the goods
How they act like they care
But they're just Robin Hoods

I wanna hear a poem where ideas kiss similes so deeply that metaphors get jealous
Where the subject matters so much that adjectives start holding pro-noun rallies at city hall

Because I wanna hear a poem that attacks the status quo
That attracts the claps of the cats with the fattest flows
That makes the crowd pass the hat
And pack my cap with a stack of dough
I wanna hear a poem that makes this audience yell ‚Äúhoooo!‚Äù (hoooo!)

Because I wanna guess your favorite color
Then craft rhyme schemes out of thin air
I wanna hear a poem about why the statute of limitations for rape is only five years
I wanna hear a poem
I wanna feel a poem
I wanna taste a poem
Give me your spot on the mic if you wanna waste a poem

I wanna
Hear
A poem
I'm pissed.

Sticks and stones may break my bones

*fin*
Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.

"A recent New Yorker cartoon summed up these recent anxieties: Two grown-ups face a child in a wall of solidarity, explaining, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre neither software nor hardware. We‚Äôre your parents.‚Äù This cartoon reminds me of a statement someone I interviewed once made about simulation and authenticity: ‚ÄúSimulated thinking can be thinking, but simulated feeling can never be feeling. Simulated love is never love.‚Äù The more we manipulate ourselves and the more our artifacts seek pride of place beside us as social and psychological equals, the more we find the issue of authenticity confronting us. Authenticity is becoming to us what sex was to the Victorians‚Äîan object of threat and obsession, of taboo and fascination."

@a ghost with purpose as well ^
This is for Andrew's game. Thoughts? @timlives @Demi Tarot
what situation is it intended for?
it ain't bad, but context is important
it feels pretty intro texty
Correct
Andrew needed a title theme that can be adopted into an overworld theme when slooowed down

@Demi Tarot listen to this. I wanna layer in bits of this with what you've already heard.
Volume warning-ish. the mezzo-forte is stronk.
a bit, but that's a pretty jiving melody

LET GO OF THE CYCLE
LET GO OF THE VOID
Pinned a message.
I will now commence the *lore dump*
**Major Factions**

**Ifen / Ifeni**
    The hound of war on the most populated continent in the world, Eoza. Of the three major nations, they are the most bloodthirsty by far. Ifen is home to the most dangerously religious zealots in the world. Ifeni scripture begins with their most beloved legend : when the All-mother departed from our world to become the Dreamwhisperer she left behind a promise : he conquers all would prove worthy enough for her to climb out of her dream palace and crown a new god and husband. This fable has many variants but is undeniably the foundation of Ifen culture.
**Yten/ Yteni**
    The oldest nation on Eoza by far. They say if you break earth anywhere in Yten eventually you‚Äôll find corpses from a long forgotten battle, and every home is built on top of some stranger‚Äôs grave. Yteni government moves slowly, and the people adapt even more slowly. Though rich in population and tradition, Yteni inflexibility to technological and magical innovation has left them victims to frequent invasion.
**Ebreth / Ebrethi**
    The Ebrethi are a desert nation. Though extremely rich in iron and other resources thanks to their bountiful mines, life here is hard. Stories say Ebreth settlers were rebels, banished from Yten long ago, and sealed away when an ancient Yteni ruler made a deal with Tautra, Keeper of Earth, to raise the Skyspear Mountains from the ground to separate the two nations. Life here is hard, but Ebrethi people thrive where they can.
**Lorix / Lorixian**
    Here, life is even harder. Lorix is a tiny nation on Eoza off the southern coast of Ifen, separated by a series of active volcanoes. Capital punishment isn‚Äôt very popular and prisons are expensive to maintain so this sorry grouping of islands along with a bit of inhabitable pennuislla became the dumping ground of criminals from all over the world, as well as a hideaway for political refugees and practioners of illegal magic. One year a few centuries back Lorixians sent back the Ifen tribute ship empty handed and the Ifeni didn‚Äôt bother doing anything about it -- there was hardly anything in Lorix worth taking. If you live in Lorix you must have pissed someone off and your life sucks, or you simply do not want to be found.
**Vanash / Vanch**
    Vanash is the large continent south of Eoza and it is a hot mess. Most of it is scorching desert but there is a swath of life that cuts through the center of it. Vanch people are tougher than their Eozan neighbors as a result of having to deal with harsher climate and more dangerous fauna, but there are far less of them. Rather than forming large cities, society here takes the form of fast changing allegiances between villages, families, and clans. Though when threatened as a collective the Vanch are willing to unite.
**Apora / Apeche**
    A mysterious continent only recently discovered. (if you choose to be from here you‚Äôll have to help me figure some stuff out). When lost sailors from Ifen stumbled upon unfamiliar, fungal forests they realized they weren‚Äôt on the far jungle shore of Yten like they hoped, but someplace entirely different. Ifen being Ifen of course they immediately launched an invasion but were defeated by the natives using strange tactics and powerful magic. Curiously, the war was brought to an end when the Ifeni Prime Patriarch was made aware these natives weren‚Äôt that different - they were dwarves, elves, humans, etc just like all the other nations. Even more curiously, they speak similar language, and worshipped the same goddess.
**Note: Races and Magic** In terms of race all the official D&D 5e races are present in good number throughout Eoza and Vanash, though no where are the races treated as equals, for example Ebreth has a strict caste system with dragonborn at the top and dwarves and halflings at the bottom. It varies from place to place. Apora as an exemption has a majority of elves but otherwise experiences a large amount of race diversity. In terms of magic, non-divine magic users are fairly uncommon in Eoza and Vanash but more popular in Apora, with wizards being very uncommon as dedicated study of magic is impossible as a result of religious witch-hunting.

**Non-nation factions**
**Listeners of the Dreamwhisperer**
    The goddess is widely worshipped all over the world in various forms.  She is considered all seeing and all powerful and is far from silent. Her title as Dreamwhisperer comes from the most consistent way people are able to commune with her, in their sleep. In Eoza priests and clerics travel from various organizations spreading her teachings based on historical scripture. In Vanash every tribe has a dreamer(a shaman dedicated to communing with the goddess), and every family prays for her blessing before taking a meal. Apeche methods of worship are mostly unknown but many have made their bodies into living tapestries, capturing fables and stories of the goddess onto their flesh.
**Pagan Churches**
    Though widespread, the dreaming goddess is not the only source of divine power in the world. Some pagans worship individuals from Dreamwhisperer legend as their true gods -- for example the Craftsman, her original husband, or a specific Realmkeeper, the guardians she left behind to maintain the world in their respective elements : earth, sea, and air. Others worship something totally unrelated ( like the god-emperor of mankind or some shit, I don‚Äôt know. Fill in the blank god to worship, just work it out with me if you fiendin‚Äô for somethin particular.)
**Independent Knight Orders**
    Popular in Eoza are groups of religious soldiers that declare allegiance to no specific nation but instead choose their loyalty based on the will of the goddess. These groups are recognized and respected across the continent and possess a significant amount of military power.
**Mercenary Companies**
    Like the knights but for gold instead of god. Bit less respected, bout half as common and powerful.
**Swamp city of Qurg**
    The Swamp City of Qurg is a strange, goddess-forsaken place. It‚Äôs long independence and neutrality has been vital to the balance of power on Eoza and serves as the only long standing tradeport between the three major nations, Lorix, and Vanash. It‚Äôs ruled by the self-proclaimed Immortal God-King Yvshnar who is feared by his subjects and respected by his enemies, even the Ifeni zealots despite his blatant, unrepentant heresy. People from Qurg tend to be strange and often stand out as a result of their inability to make eye contact, and tendency to wear clothing to conceal their faces. There‚Äôs a saying that goes something like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never see a Qurg‚Äôs face twice.‚Äù The city under Yvshnar‚Äôs leadership has turned back dozens of attempted invasions just in recent history, despite lacking any sort of standing military.
**Note: Intro quest** - An ancient city of Dreamwhisperer legend has been discovered in the stubborn ocean between Eoza and Apora. Global tensions are high in this gold rush but the would-be instigators of war, (Ifen if that wasn‚Äôt obvious) are reeling from a recent conquest over Yten (called Ifeni-minor now by the conquerors), and a temporary solution has been reached: the Ifeni Expeditionary force that controls the ruins (but lacks the manpower to explore it properly) will allow anyone to join them so long as they bear a banner of truce and pay tribute, of course. The journey there has proved exceptionally dangerous, with as many as three in five ships finding the bottom of the ocean rather than their destination. For reasons of your choice you‚Äôve found your way to these ruins, and luckily you‚Äôve survived the trip. (we‚Äôll figure out some details about why your characters are actually a party during session zero)

*caveat any of these names might possibly be changed and some things I don‚Äôt have names yet for but I will ( the goddess for example )
invite link is at the top and pinned, lemme know if any questions
your character should have some affiliation with one of these factions or if they all sound lame to you i will smith a new one
oh yeah heres a map with some labels
would love to do session zero sometime this weekend and start next week im good to go for the first few sessions prep-wise
You said lore "dump" this is a lore *nuke*
:yes:
busy night
you interested in playin? @Koala
oh right you have work and probably cant read through all this rn
I'm working from home and reading this during a conf call lol
unfortunately I can't really commit to a full campaign rn, especially this month since in a week i'll be traveling
kk this will run a few months at least so you could jump in sometime in january maybs
I could be an on again/off again character at most lol
:worryThumbsUpSad:
we'll see once it gets to January
yee
oh well you'll just missout on my homebrew *death table*
the ever important question.
what flavor of waifu have I not made yet?
I've done noble but naive...noble
I've done sassy morally gray waifu
Big Sister type
Strong slappy type
Airhead (Tomboy)
and Airhead (Chuuni/Bimbo hybrid)
and Pure maiden
ummm
the mischevious teasing type?
I think Burgundy had that going for her
I think some I've not done for this group are
-Ara Ara Milf
-Big Tiddy Goth GF
-Stuck up Noble that's kind of a bitch, but not in a way that's grating or gets the party into extra trouble by making any diplomacy impossible because she's an obstinate brat
is this setting related to the game project we attempted last year?
theres some ideas i cannablized but overall not really
character stats are 3d6, 2 sets of 6 pick which one you want. if your average modifier is +1 or lower let me know and we can make a deal (gain a cool thing to compensate for bad stats) or you can roll again
How do we feel about Celestial Warlocks?
Warlocks are generally perceived evil, which I feel the celestial subclass kinda' "subverts" (aka make redundant in a fun way). What "Celestial" patron would you picture? I immediately thought of the Goddess, especially with the dream communication stuff.
Being a Warlock to the Goddess sounds kind of stronk though, so let me know if that's on the table, or how that would affect my relationships with the Whisperers or the IKO.
First of all, I don't think the association of warlock and evil would be very strong here. A Celestial Warlock in this setting  would be like someone that has made a divine connection to some entity, like the Dreamwhisperer for example but bypasses or disregards the church or whatever existing structure of faith. In Ifen the effect of this would be the church really hates you, because you prove that they are in some ways redundant, but your powers are indisputable and respected.
it gets trickier but potentially more interesting if you choose a patron besides the Dreamwhisperer. For example, Vyshnar, Immortal God-King of Qurg could be your patron and your character as a Qurg would be **very** differently received compared to the previous example.
there are some other strong options too, like the Craftsman, first of good men and husband to the goddess when she walked among mortals. There's an entity I'll call the Forlorn Wanderer who's the Realmkeeper of the afterlife -- his domain is the realm between the mortal world we live in and the void that awaits all mortal souls after death.
basically Celestial warlocks are the kids who got a meager 1 million donation from their parents to start a business
@Demi Tarot @mannie.exe chu two are the only ones not squared away on char lemme know if you need my help with anythin' or make some progress
just a bit of the ol Choice paralysis
I'm trying to get over it by not depending on other people as much
but in this case since it's a co-operative party thing it might not be super bad to get some insight on preferences
you talkin flavor wise or more class/party complimenting wise?
...yes
I'll type up my current stuff with their pros and cons after I get my hot pocket
you ever have to reheat a hot pocket because everything went to shit as soon as you get it out of the microwave?
ah yes the hotter pocket
goat problems
let's move on to this to stave off a mental breakdown, yes
Note that those designs are far from final, they were basically an anchor point to work from

Gold: Protector Aasimar, Divine Soul Sorcerer.
Pros: Ara Ara MILF. Fits very nicely in the setting. Motivation is simple but effective. Very clear voice of reason
Cons: We got a lot of divine firepower in the party comp so far.

Purple: Fallen Aasimar, Shadow Sorcerer
Pros: Big Tiddy Goth GF. Good contrast to the party. A slightly more edgy voice of reason
Cons: Motivation may take a bit of lore wiggles

Green: Aladrin (Rogue, Bard or Fighter)
Pros: Midriff, Interesting Personality
Cons: presently unclear motivations,
i love lore wiggles
shout out to the time someone wanted to be necromancer in once of my settings where I deliberately said that animating the dead was the same type of magic as making golems, and "necromantic" or "negative energy" didn't exist, but rather than say no I wound up thinking of how ghosts and undead worked in the setting and ended up with cool stuff
for Aasimar purposes basically means yer mum or yer dad was one of the five direct descendants of the goddess, these are immortal beings and most of them have cults or sects of worship in their own right but aren't quite god-level power. I haven't given them names yet but they are roughly The Heiress, The Mage, The Trickster, The Reclaimer, and The Disowned.  if you'd like to know more about any of your potentially divine dads or mums i can extrapolate
I AM RECLAIMER OF MY NAAAAAME
BORN IN FLAMES! I HAVE BEEN BLESSED!
***MY FAMILY CREST IS A DEMON OF DEATH~***
ü§ò
but I can imagine which one would go to which concept are obvious
ye. its more shorthand for the most notable thing about them, of course these are Real Characters with Multi Dimensional Personalities but those dont need to exist yet üôÇ
I do want to try a Scourge Aasimar at some point
but that's for another game
Other than some outfit embellishments, I think Vikara is done
What'd ya pick?
Fighter Eladrin Swamp Yakuza

:PepoCheer:
Here's our TRPG general @everyone @Koala.
hi
I'll bring in those resources @Mujin posted and the big D&D Google Drive as well.
Maps n shit
Pinned a message.
D&D Resource Books, Homebrew, and a Few Maps:
Pinned a message.
So I was looking through DnD Beyond earlier, and I was just marveling at just how similar the experience was to what I had in mind for our TIY project. @Mujin
In my head I considered this the most optimal way of creating an online D&D character. Highly simplified, one-concern-per-page routine.
At that time I had been inspired by this contact form library that I found which did just that: ask you one questions on a page at a time.
I know! That‚Äôs what I thought too when I first signed up! The only thing I wash they had was integration with roll20. Especially since both are affiliates of wizards now
That'd be neat, but non-Pro members of Roll20 have no direct way of importing or moving characters around. The only mechanism even Pro members have for that is the Character Vault system.
Would be neat to see how they implement it.
True. I‚Äôd easily pay for roll20 if there was integration between the two
Regretting not making that character creator now a little, would have made for a great portfolio piece... ^^'
So, do you know how the Roll20 Pro plugin/extension system works?
It's a JavaScript hook into their entire system.
Nothing stopping you now!
No ideal lol
It's bloody fucking awesome.
It would be sooo cool to have a web application that you can create characters on, set some sort of private key, and use that + a custom JavaScript plugin on Roll20 just straight import characters.
With this approach, only the DM would have to have Roll20 Pro as well.
Just picture a Node.js back-end with some object-based database system, and a front-end that allows users to create and save characters into it. The JavaScript plugin would function as a secondary "front-end", in that would just connect to the back-end, get the data, and fill it into the appropriate character sheets for each imported character.
That would be awesome!
Also, unfortunately what's stopping is the D&D copyright, mwahaha. I could still use a ton of Open5e stuff though.
True! Or just keep it private lol
I might also be able to provide a simple hook to homebrew classes, races, archetypes and such on the spot, allowing you to manually add copyrighted material as well.
idk if I would wanna privatize it though. Too many downsides as opposed to just allowing users to fill in their own gaps.
Especially if I wanna use it as a portfolio piece.
Not privatize it but just not advertise it
Ah, but that would still be considered "distribution of copyrighted material".
True lol too much thought for me
Wizards of the Coast are mostly concerned with their book-specific, non-open "information" or "data" being available without purchase -- anywhere.
There were quite a few apps that functioned as pocket PHB's and such prior to mass DMCA's.
If I allow users to use the same data in any shape or form, I'm would be under the same classification of illegal distributor of copyrighted material.
...more specifically, if I myself _provide_ users with that data to be used en masse in their own characters, I'm a target.
But if I _allow_ users to bring in their own values, or data, than nothing's on me directly.
You could start off with just including data from the free resource that wizards has up
Precisely my train of thought.
Regardless, it is both a little demoralizing but also super positive to think that what I had in mind for a product is now an official impmlementation.
It's like, on one hand, it's such a big morale boost to realize that you were on the right track the entire time, but at the same time... damn, I wish I had actually done it.
I would say only think of it as a positive! We identified a need in the market just didn‚Äôt have the resources. Nothing we can do against an amazon company lol
Haha, yeah, when you put it like that...
Also, sux that I can't use Kenku in DnD Beyond unless I buy the Volo's extension (or the Legendary pack).
...and since we can't Homebrew classes, _ahem ahem_, there's no way to finish my character sheet.
Hey guys  michael and i will have to miss dnd due to a family event. soooo what do you all want to do?
probably just take it easy, or we could throw together a one shot or side story on our own
probably just take it easy, or we could throw together a one shot or side story on our own

liiiike something that lets you conjure magcal daggers. You could make a reliable ranged attack or two as is, OR, if you got people up in your face, Shotgun a fan of daggers in a cone that needs a Dex Save to dodge
man i just wrote a thousand word  essay for a D&D characters backstory(edited)
and that shit was **fun**
I'm starting a little personal writing project - a supplementary text for D&D that consists primarily of the magic items that I've thought of, with names and little backstories. Partly so I keep track of all the magic item ideas I've had, and partly to share a bunch of magical items with the world
neat
**Lotte:** God I wish that was me
hey if anyone wants to run a one shot or solo campaing hmu
im bored and itchin to dizzle and dizzle
Hey guys I found pictures of @Mujin's Albion character.
Here's a picture of him when he was a little baby.
Licorice toothpaste? ( 'A')
Fixed.
probably buying a pro sub to roll20 so we'll have some new toys to play around with üòÑ
if you guys ever have any campaigns you GM let me know and I'll create it for you so you get the PRO benefits
Oh could you please make one for me? @a ghost with purpose
@mannie.exe  wanna help me test some things?
Of course!
I would definitely like to try some of the scripting available.
Also, could you make one for me on  as well?
That's their "dev" branch.
cmere
nerds
keep me posted on the *Dank Shit*‚Ñ¢ you pull off
@Demi Tarot  btw are you good to play an Albion session friday post 9 pm
yes
I have acquire **[An Actual Mobile Phone]**
Man, yer' getting better.
power of money
"Alright, Tony, did you finish changing your character from a wrestler to a rogue?"
"Yeah, but I was in a rush so I may have missed something in my equipment"
"I'm sure it's fine"
....
"I attack the goblin with my throwing....chairs."
alternatively Wizard casts Stop Time and rapidly casts animate object
wow that's a lot to take in at once
SO
I FOUND A GEM OF A WEBSITE
It has literally a SHIT ton of stuff for D&D, and a FUCK load of other RPG systems as well.
Unfortunately, there's no way to mass download shit from the server yet, so I wrote a Python script to crawl through subdirs and batch download all of the files.
I'm gonna do a session with @a ghost with purpose -- haven't decided when yet, but knowing the two us, the possibilities are endless. If @everyone wants to join, let me know and either Andrew or I can send you an invite.
Use these links to get access to the official rulebooks:  and  for a bunch of 3rd party jazz.
is the link to that
**IMPORTANT**: for those of you who feel those links are a little overwhelming due to the sheer amount of content, I present you with this:
Just some of the very basic rulebooks to minimize distraction. The folder is still uploading so everything that I've uploaded may not be entirely there  yet, but it should have the main handbook, Volo's, Xanathar's, and all of the Unearthed Arcana after it's done uploading. Refresh the page a little later to reload missing content. If there's something missing in here that you'd like to try, refer back to the earlier big-dick links of plentiful variety.
I added the Elemental Evil Player's Companion to the GDrive folder.
I know both Volo's and EE have a Goliath race. idk if there are any differences but check through the two since you're playing one anyways. @a ghost with purpose
They are the same.
Idea 1) Beauty obsessed crossdresser, likely a bard. Can be very cold and callous towards things he deems ugly, has no mercy for monsters.
Idea 2) Greedy Dwarf with impressive muscle and impressive facial hair as most dwarves do. Obsessed with shining gems and gold some say joke he's part dragon. Crass and Macho.
Idea 3) Curiously handsome Orc Barbarian. His father was a bard you see, one of the best.
Idea 4) Possibly a troubled rogue.
2) would love to see you play that kind of char
4) my curiosity picks this one as my fav
Idea 5) Dude who collects enchanted swords
Idea 6) man who coughs intermittently and pauses for awkward amounts of time before he starts speaking again, probably interrupting whoever tries to speak during the awkward pause
I‚Äôm definitely not projecting my coworker onto a character
I'd like to see No. 2, it's the most different from your other characters I've seen
If  I wanna do a proper voice I‚Äôd need phlegm in the back of my throat
@a ghost with purpose If you want to play a one shot I have an idea for a heroic dnd session.
Dougal Goldmiser
Be a paladin whos deity is just gold
That‚Äôs not hoe it works
It is if there's enough paladins whose deity is gold
thursday one shot
When you are wielding a finesse weapon with whichyou are proficient and another creature  hits you witha melee attack, you can use your reaction to add yourproficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentiallycausing the attack to miss you.
I made a generic enemy token
fookin' I just thought of it, but I wanna try being a Fuzzum Rider Grumbly at some point
On the subject of voicing characters, I think my kinda not high not derp voice is probably close to a grumblina
A Likely scenario involving Neela
"Isn't it impractical to go into the field with that much cleavage?"
"Wot? S'where oi keep me 'nocs. S'why they call'em knockers."
"Excuse me? your what?"
"Me 'nocs." *whips binoculars out*
**Player:** can I be a barbarian with a Katana?
**DM:** what? no. What would that even look like?
**Player:**
**DM:** Y'know what, on second thought...

Lotte's character arc
bought some critical role shizzzz
Large man cuddles God, Colorized @Mujin
Had a pretty interesting idea for a campaign setting. Renaissance theme?
Ooh that sounds fun
Floppy hats all around!
WoW!
I feel like a campaign with a Final Fantasy Tactics kinda tone would be fun to run but politics is hard
Got some war stuff going on but like not as much focus on large scale battles so much as skirmishes and junk
I've always thought an industrial revolution kinda setting would be cool
The hardest part is figuring out how magic would impact society
Magic assisted industry
Like some alchemists created enchanted coal or some shit
Fire magic - lit lamps on the streets
But like what are the societal consequences? Would child labor have been such a large issue if you just had to pay a single sorcerer to do 100x the work?
Man made tools and machines that can manipulate magic for use in heavy industry, manufacturing, etc
Idk those are the sorts of questions I try to ask myself if I‚Äôm coming up with ideas
Like magic constructs and golems
Damn that would be dope
I used that in an unused and unnamed campaign setting I tried to model ages ago. @Mujin
It had this slightly Final Fantasy-esque, arcana-powered, steampunk vibe to it, but since magic was so potent and avoided a lot of the compromises that occurred due to industrialization, it felt more like a mix between the Fullmetal Alchemist universe and something like FFXIV, than something more traditionally steampunk.
That‚Äôs really cool!
Want power leveling in Diablo III? @Deleted User
Also to @Demi Tarot and @timlives ^
I home
Hello home
Me home dos
@Mujin  have you read what the dmg says about the "how magic affects the setting"
Doesnt say a ton but theres some good stuff
"It sets shit on fire. Fuckin wild, mate."
How do I read a damage?
"It sets shit on fire. Fuckin wild, mate."
('^' )oœÉ get a load of this guy
it's the Dangit Man's Guide
I present early Dadthew Mercer
God _damn_
he was _that kid_ in hs
well he's aged quite gracefully
Do you still want me to bring my mic setup if we can use @timlives's? @a ghost with purpose
Psst, @Mujin and @Demi Tarot. We're not doing my campaign anymore. I got a lot of shit on my plate and I thought I'll be able to chisel the time and the mindset to pull it off, but that's too farfetched at the moment. We'll keep that campaign, setting, and characters open because I would like to still do it sometimes later in the year. Sorry about that, but this seems like the smartest decision at the moment. So for now, we only have one weekly campaign: Andrew's.
heek
It‚Äôs guuud man
I think I got a plot synopsis for my campaign idea.

*"The Theocracy of Frenon is in the midst of a Civil War. When King Argust suddenly passed from illness the kingdom was left with no heir. Holding sway in Frenon's politics, Pope Egilon appointed his daughter, Emeraldis to take the throne as queen. Before her coronation, however, rumor spread of a potential heir appearing; Lionel, a bastard child of Argust holding an heirloom blade. The air became tense as debates raged, and arguments rang out, lines were drawns and houses were divided. Soon violence broke out between those who sided with the church, and those that sided with the crown."*
comments or questions?
Civil wars are fun
man, now that I've been floundering on the notes all day, really dunno if I can pull off this kinda plot
Its okay to create or attempt something thats less than perfect
Even if its bad, still fine cuz its the best way to improve :)
It‚Äôs less I don‚Äôt think it would be perfect and more I can‚Äôt grasp the subject well enough to handle it properly
Like a good thing to know in a war centric campaign is who actually controls the army
the general ofc
the war council
sarge peters
whoever really
Not what I meant
What did you mean?
aye what do you mean here
now that I'm home
fuckin, usually the head of the government ultimately commands the army but in this case where there is no ruler
like, would the Pope's Daughter run one side and Lionel the other
would the Pope's Daughter have any reasonable explanation for being able to lead an army, would some nerd who just claims to be an heir just be allowed an army? like dang
Oh, like a head of state
?
Because usually it would be a general or a Lord leading
So, yeah, maybe Daughter would lead, if such a thing would be tolerated by the nobles on her side
Or a male Lord (possibly one vying for her hand, hmmmmmmm?) that's had experience leading troops before or is simply charismatic enough.
Lionel, ye olde bastarde heire
Could probably lead as well. Like you said, the various nobles of the land picked their sides, so there's multiple candidates for leadership.
And the leader is usually the one who bought a bunch of men, or the most experienced one, or the natural leader, or simply the one they picked to lead them
@Demi Tarot
I'd say in Daughter's case she'd be more of a symbol, nominally having a leadership role, hell maybe she's actually quite the master of court politics, but the military is a man's job and that's what her father and all the other nobles throwing their lot in with her are gonna say
What say you J-a-red @Demi Tarot
maybs
_**AHHHHHHHHHHHHH**_
Wind Chime thinks to himself, sooon....
I need everyone to have significant outfit changes by the time we hit Level 6 for the Tier 2 Tokens
I think I have an idea for a campaign that's a bit smaller scale than my other idea, in fact it's in one city, but I got a better grasp on it with some groups and main NPCs already in my notes. I think to properly tailor the story for the party I'd need character motivations
A group of adventurers, each with their own reasons, travel far from their homes and meet at the gates of the sprawling city of Briskwillow. However immediately upon entering they find things are not right here.  The people are less than hospitable and the sun never shines, and everywhere they go there seems to be a miasma plaguing the streets.
so interested dorks inquire away
wow so it's a pretty hardcore campaign
What's super special about the city?
it's old as balls, as a well known academy where all the greatest minds used to go to to study and consult with other scholars, so naturally as well as advancements with magic and technology, they had a lot of medical and historic knowledge
though like for different motivations, maybe you go there seeking medical help, or wish to study a rare or unethical text you can't find. Maybe you're looking for someone, or maybe you're a missionary of the Church of St. Morgan who is heading in to assist that front.
though like for different motivations, maybe you go there seeking medical help, or wish to study a rare or unethical text you can't find. Maybe you're looking for someone, or maybe you're a missionary of the Church of St. Morgan who is heading in to assist that front.
It's not entirely unknown that it's fallen from grace, so some seek to purify it, some seek to pilfer artifacts that may have been left behind, some go there out of desperation
basically if you pitch a concept at me, I can probably find a way to fit it in

shit dude
@Mujin
Lololol I‚Äôm watching their c2e2 panel right now
map asset folder reminder for myself
Pinned a message.
@everyone  probably starting a **Stars Without Number** campaign next weekend, will be sunday evenings most likely. It's a sci-fi system about space ships, exploration, and aliens, lemme know if you're interested. Jared and M.Bolton are on board already and I'm lookin' for 4-5 players total , if someone else wants to play or even GM this for sure lemme know
Pass on GM, but would like to play. @a ghost with purpose
so we have three
I no can master but maeby play
we could use a shootmin
Once I'm done with the school I'll have time
how much longer you got?
first sesh is may 6, can always join the campaign after a few weeks when the semester ends
^ and that will be more like a session 0 than a proper session
Let me take a look at the system. I‚Äôve been wanting to GM for awhile
Two more weeks of class then finals
The system is OSR(old school Renaissance)  and the setting is super sci-fi, I think 2d6+mod is the most common roll and each skill check is usually tiered like 1-5 failure, 6-10 partial success, 10+ complete success. Combat is pretty similar to D&D now, exception for space combat. There's also a lot of back-end faction management the spacemaster has to do.
I got the deluxe edition. I‚Äôll throw that up on the dnd google drive here in a bit
communism
fully automated luxury gay space communism
Whoops sorry that‚Äôs a single file. One sec
Cars without Bumpers
nice, lemme know what you think of it-- if you just want to play instead of run it that's cool too, we've played maybe five sessions total of the original
who gonna DM?
me unless someone else wants to
Ooh I forgot one of the new features is weapon modifications, you can try and tinker an auto-targeting mod on your sniper rifle if you wanted
Or mod a semi-auto pistol to a fully auto one, etc
so we can have a fully semi-automatic pistol
you hold down the trigger but it only shoots one bullet a second?
after a few years in modern civilization would Viv change up clothes to less flowy robes and more skin tight and futurey like this
what psionics are you gonna take
Telekinesis and Teleport
or Double down on Telekinesis and get teleport later we'll see
mind movin' powa
I feel doubling down at the start may be more useful so I can have an actual technique and do some heavy lifting, instead of just being able to carry smaller stuff at a distance and teleport 10 meters
man look at this SWN art
not from the book
So our four starting players are Michael Michael Mannie Jared, possible stephan later
We have the roles on the ship that need filled: Captain, Bridge(pilot), Comms, Gunnery, Engineering. The section that isn't covered by you guys will be played by me, and if your PC can't do any of those then you'll take control of an NPC in that department during any space flights. (Say if you're a primitive psychic QT)
Captain and Engineering taken
I'll fill ( 'u')
since a few years in modern life probably isn't enough to know how to spess ship
we're spinning wheels on characters if ya wanna join
100k budget on shipping - page 96. You guys get to customize the ship, keep in mind mass and power limits
Need at least one person trained in each of these: Talk, Heal, Pilot
sounds like what Mann the Man Man wanted to do, at least 2 of those anyways
expect a setting blurb tomorrow üòÑ
since we're rolling all our characters already the 6th will be a proper first session not a 0th
You guys heard of this new band Kojima's directing and producing for with Guillermo Del Toro?
Norman Reedus and the Funky Fetus?
for some clarificiating, I'm taking telekinetic armory, since I feel even if I'm avoiding combat, it may prove handy to have a means of armor and weaponry. it says I can make either an advanced melee weapon or a rifle
does the "rifle" have a magazine? since I assume it is literally me just force punching air at people
Woah that's dope.
And yeah, Piloting is a definite for me, and I will pick up either Heal or Talk along with it.
I _would_ like to see the run-down of everybody's skills. Less to min-max and more just get a feel for how everybody will fit and play mechanically. I know Mike's the ship captain with an Expert background. Which gives a pretty good idea of what to expect, and I know Michael's a cybernetic technician.
Anything to add to above? @timlives @Mujin
my other abilities I could choose at this level is automatic space suit or walking up walls. All are useful, but I'm not sure how often we'll be going into hazardous environments or stuff like that
I can see why you'd wanna go for base survivability at the moment and taking telekinetic armory.
It's what sort of normalizes your actions with everybody else's.
But yeah, they all sound useful.
Make sure you guys fill me in with everything you're willing to spare. Read above. @Mujin @timlives
no u
Michael's playing Scotty
I have connect, fix, know, notice, program
my skills are notice, sneak, survive aaaand maybe exert? since she was suited to sneaking around the woods and popping in to town on occasion to steal food
Cyber Builder
Exert is basically athletics
Ahhh, as in, physically exerting yourself to accomplish tasks.
I see.
Cool cool.
she run, she swim, she climb
What about @Koala? I know I heard the word "Merchant" thrown aorund.
she bloop
What about Talk? Is that something Stephan would be used to?
He's gonna be playing a warrior with merchant background I believe, running Comms
I seeee.
Aye
Awesome.
Then I think I'll look into Piloting and Healing.
so I think I might be taking talk
Cool, that'll leave gunnery but I think @a ghost with purpose has plans for that. Hopefully we won't be needing to do that as much as we thought our last *-# session(s).
I LOVE IT.
HYPED.
AHHH.
Jared's covering Gunnery, though he'll be acting through an NPC - likely his character's psychic mentor
I see.
I SEE.
This means both my Saturdays and Sundays are taken up by tabletop RPGs now.
Again, I love it.
A good way to spend your evenings
Surely.
I should read the pow pow shooty rolls then
glancing over this a Corvette style ship is a Frigate class wiiiiiith
Speed of 2, 10 Armor, 40 HP, a crew of 10-40 people with at least 6 of those being our PCs, and my NPC surrogate
AC of 13
Power of 15 and Mass of 15 for fitting stuff
and 6 Hard points for weapons
and if we dunno what the fuck we want there's an example on one page 105
mhm, I'm picking weapons and armor, you guys are fitting minor systems up to $100k
uh, for a Frigate class 100k doesn't go very far
So it's a Frigate
Not a corvette
Corvette's are frigates
Yeah, I forgot to accommodate for the frigate price bump, will updoot the  buying limit in a bit
you got Fighters, Friggers, Cruisers and Capitalists
Corvettes are a class below Frigate
the Hull type is a frigate but its larger and better
not in this game
Ah
It's a step below *Heavy Frigate* in the rules which is the frigate type you're thinking of
Now I'm going to be bothered lol
nah
to quote the book, it is the smallest combat frigate and is usually what people refer to when people say "frigate"
Basically the corvette is the smallest combat dedicated frigate option
and should be perfectly fine when dealing with the usual pirate scum, if we piss off any military hit the fucking spike drive
You guys are basically starting in a five million dollar ship
^credit
think last time we played you only had a free merchant hull, and like $1mil ship value
bumped to 650k spending limit on your ship outfittings
@Demi Tarot
aight
Also, our ship will be a bit modified from traditional corvette stats, consider it like an *advanced first prototype* of a model that could have substantially more power than traditional corvettes
Updated D&D resource list. Now it's an RPG folder and also contains *-#. @everyone
@mannie.exe  do you wanna spin up your character after my D&D sesh tonight?
Would you like to be my lovely assistant and the guided tour? Still haven't read the material.
Yas
I'll let you know when I'm done
I'll be here too
mostly because it's friday
but also because fffffffFFFFFFFFFFUCK YES no more class ever*

*assuming there is no last second GOTCHA bullshit
Hell yeah!
Congrats again boi.
You did a thing.

^ link to Mike's campaign
Your hobgoblin character has the following racial traits.
Ability Score Increase

Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
Age

Hobgoblins mature at the same rate as humans and have lifespans similar in length to theirs.
Alignment

Hobgoblin society is built on fidelity to a rigid, unforgiving code of conduct. As such, they tend toward lawful evil.
Size

Hobgoblins are between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.
Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‚Äôt discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Martial Training

You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor.
Saving Face

Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can‚Äôt use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

Not with that attitude
Method 1 - Race = Class - Branching Playstyles
-See Wakfu
Method 2 - each Race has 3 different Classes
-Classes may branch a bit?
Method 3 - Race and Class are separate, but each Class gets a unique quality depending on Race
-Classes may or may not be unavailable to certain races?
Shaman - Makes use of Totems to apply AoE effects to assist allies or deter enemies. Totems are representiative of animal spirits and when struck with a spell, perform a unique effect to the tiles around them. (Yeti)

Barbarian - Hardened warriors who use their fury to perform supernatural feats of physcal prowess. Can utilize Ice to keep enemies within their reach, and harm those that surround them. Accumulating Fury allows them to strike harder and stave off defeat. (Yeti)

Onmyoji - A caster that utilizes paper talismans to preform magical spells. Has varying effeccts if it lands on a tile or lands on a unit. Placing a talisman on a tile will result in a terrain affect on those who step in its range, while tagging a unit will do more concentrated effects on that unit. (Weeb)

Ronin - Utilizes a multitude of stances and techniques to adjust with the flow of battle. (Weeb)

Phase Knight - A swordman who steps through space to harry foes and attack from unexpected areas. (Etheral)

Void Caster - A magician who uses portals to alter their range and attack in unique ways. (Etheral)

Tracker - Works in tandem with a trusted animal partner to ruthlessly hound foes.

Golem Rider - Pilots a behemoth made of clay.

Orbital - Summons and utilizes tiny support drones to attack, support and hinder.

Heat Hexxer - Fights using fire, has to regulate their heat levels for optimal damage without burning themselves out.

Cleric - A dedicated member of the cloth who beseeches divine blessings to mend wounds, and guide their allies. (Holy)

Paladin - A holy warrior who seeks to protect his allies and smite his foes. Focuses on acting as a wall, and using their mighty shield to direct their foes. (Holy)

Doppleganger - A sneaky combatant who battles alongside a duplicate of themselves. Clever use of the double can allow for pincer attacks and getting out of unfavorable situations.

Venomancer - An assassin that relies on caustic mixtures to bring down foes.

@Demi Tarot thoughts on duo campaign with u and mikil where you both have 2 characters
or if thats not interesting just a duo hero campaign
hm, I'd be fine if it was just the two of us, I personally have issues trying to do two characters at once, but I could at least give it a shot if you're unsure on being able to balance around less people and/or reluctant to pad our party with NPCs

nah, but that's a good idea  down the line

Quite a ways off with the Andrew game and a few other things on my plate but uh,
interest in trying 4e at some point?
no i already have a cucks, second-hand judgement of 4e -- i'm good
I'll cuck you ( 'A')9
I thought you were a woman.
also did you just join as soon as Andrew left?
that won't stop me
hawt
I walked in and he screamed in primal terror and left
poor guy
probably joined in on him master
ing his new soundtracks for the next D&D campaign
that would be pretty extra if he learned how to muzak just to enrich the experience
no i had to practice with the boys
idk about 4e
not anytime soon jurd
@Demi Tarot @timlives think i need to delay our duo campaign, im too stressed/distracted by the tourney thing coming up to brainstorm
we do it next week
that's fine
though is it a delay if we never set a time?
true
@Demi Tarot can you help me think of a name for my character
I named myself after a fucking cake
please this is the hardest part
name yourself after a different cake
okay done
I found our cake
I mean.
I guess?
I got this strange urge to make a long-term kinda thing, like a good and wholesome 1-20, but I just know I won't be able to get a full party for that
That's just an idea man.
That's just an idea.
( '^')
('^' )
( '^') yeah?
@Demi Tarot @a ghost with purpose so we fukin' ?
I think we are post malone
damn
fock i still really wanna play
if we can squeeze it in today lemme know jurd
if your other session gets cancelled or something
heck
but its probably a next week thing
and thats fine
the pain in the ass thing is we're scheduling it around one guy's work schedule which is really inconsistent and whack and will probs be an issue with the other stuff I'm trying to plan around
if it happens at all
tonight seems to be set at any rate
but like I forgot the characterization for my characters already, and the wait's killed the hype, and I'm also in less of a desperate position than when I agreed ( =A=)
was it like weeks ago
yeah
LAST MINUTE CANCEL GOGOGOGOGO
*whips car around*
shiet i have
bidness
does this seem Charlottey? @timlives
I love it
nice
since the Windoll's one ability was oddly worded and kinda dull I replaced it with this

`***Overclock.*** As an action you can turn your key beyond it's usual means, your perception and reflexes temporarily increase as if time has slowed. For 1 minute you have advantage on Dexterity and Wisdom Checks, as well as attack rolls. When the effect ends you suffer one level of exhaustion.`

any idea if this sounds useful and/or balanced?
yeah it could be useful
like a mini haste, with a drawback
question is how many times you can use it in a day? like one or like until you kill yourself
I was thinking that stacking exhasution would be incentive to not abuse it, but if you want to kill yourself go for it
imagine some one else forcing the key to turn until the windoll just breaks
I mean that is a fucked up but possible thing to do I guess
I think since the increased awareness makes sense for Perception, it doesn't really make sense for other Wisdom type rolls, so I think I'll replace that with an AC bonus
`***Overclock.*** As an action you can turn your key beyond it's usual means, your perception and reflexes temporarily increase as if time has slowed. For 1 minute you have advantage on Dexterity checks and saves, as well as attack rolls. Additionally you receive +2 AC if you are not wearing heavy armor. When the effect ends you suffer one level of exhaustion.`
also the key has a bit of resistance to it, which is good indicator of when you're supposed to not crank it anymore, and it ramps up the more you twist, so like, twisting it till you immediately die takes a *lot* of strength and patience. Still could fuck'em up though
so it's not like every Windoll has a giant "please kill me switch" people can just grab, you need some torture device bullshit for that
still that's pretty fucked to think about
about the same as twisting someone's arm the wrong way
running some math with Overclock here, and I believe the exhaustion is a good drawback to give diminishing returns on using it so you don't spam it repeatedly unless you really need too.
0- Pop it, get all buffs, once it wears off; Disadvantage on Ability Checks
1 - Pop it, Advantage on Attacks, Dex Saves, Neutral on Dex Checks, +2 AC, once it wears off half speed.
2- Pop it, Same as above, once it wears off disadvantage on attacks and saves too
3- Pop it, neutral advantage, +2 AC; wears off half max HP
4- as above, wears off 0 speed
5- as above, wears off DIE
and needing a full rest to knock off each point is not trivial, so it can be a tough choice to decide when is best to use it.

vague DM question Mr.DM
if you got a solid plot for something, but are still unsure if it's enough content for a session, how do you usually add to it to make it fun and engaging?
Start thinking about it. Writing it down if you have bad memory.
Go from detail to detail, scene to scene.
Both in the sense of us playing as players n' DM vs characters.
Then you can try to manage what moments happen when in terms of [ in-world { events, scenes, et cetera } vs. what we're looking to do as players ]. Like, we could easily just be doing nothing but talking, but it's made enjoyable for engagement -- right? So "content" is technically just what we're looking for, as players and DM, to get out of having a good old D&D.
So, just do what I do and try to take a very objective, cinematographer (moving illustrator's #relatability) approach to capture important details + a sense of what we'll be doing "offstage": talking, listening to you, (keep) rolling, rolling, rolling, _doing combat_, _attempting to interact with NPCs_, and _attempting to figure out what each of our character's likes so we can either piss each other off or make each other fall in love but hush that's a secret_.
@Demi Tarot hope that helps #NotARealDM
sort of
Well, if I simplify it, it just sounds stupid: a) define what "content" is, b) picture what the plot would be like "in performance"/IRL, c) ask yourself, "is there enough content"?
UNLESS YOU MEAN LIKE

since you're not (tee hee) *Party* to this I can probably be more specific IN THE SHADOWS

How broken would a racial ability to make 1 shortsword or dagger per long rest that is a +1 but has a chance of breaking on use?
after consulting some other nerds I managed to knock it down to
`***Crystal Armory.*** A signature talent of the Chateau is the ability to create weapons from the latent mana in the air. During a long rest, a Chateau may create one of the following weapons: Dagger, Shortsword, or Javelin. You are proficient with these weapons.

Weapons created in this fashion are identical to their standard forms, but deal an additional 1d6 damage and break if a 1 is rolled on an attack roll.`

do these work for species names of birb? I'm bad at this
Fat Birb - likes food, big ol wind breath, a chonk, lives in wooded areas.
Stylin Birb - greedy, most similar to traditional dragons with fire breath and treasure hordes. prefer hills and grass lands.
Swole Birb - believe might makes right, flightless, monstrously powerful, live in deserts.
Ninja Birb - have bone masks and poison breath, sneaky, lives in wetlands.
Smart Birb - loves knowledge, riddles and philosophy, lives in mountains and usually prefer solitude, can breathe illusionary fog
Wet Birb - uuuuh, lives in the ocean, not sure what it's deal is beyond that tbh

I feel this
ayyy
Pinned a message.
my brain is doing a heck, and wants me to work on a thing without really giving me much to work with so I'm just going to ramble in this channel to clear the gunk out or something since no one else is around to receive my primordial word vomit
I know not the concept or tone for this new setting and system, but a concept I'm wanting to explore is unique feeling classes that are somewhat intermingled with race/species. The hell does that mean? Well basically the main focus with playstyle is one the class itself, whose significance or abilities is intertwined with the abilities and culture of the world's races
since I've not come up with anything yet, I'll use Wonderlust races as an example since that was sort of how that setting worked until I retooled magic and junk
a Choir Mage or War Dancer are two different kinds of classes that would play differently, but their expertise and abilities, and origin are with the Fasolatis. So rather than selecting a Fasolati and noting it's racial abilities, then picking a class from the class abilities and writing all that down, you would just be like "I want to play a Choir Mage this time." and your character would happen to be a Fasolati and any relevant racial abilities would be rolled into the class's kit
My goal with creating classes is to A) make them fairly unique while still having them be categorized by roles so people can glean their purpose for party comp B) give them abilities useful in and out of combat and C) give them some degree of variation/customization so that players can have some degree of uniqueness with their characters
in regards to that, I was pondering on the implications of if a class was reliant on a specific weapon or weapon type i.e a unique cultural weapon (like a Midraul's quillblade) or a specialized weapon, such as enchanted swords/bows/ pact weapon,s how that would affect treasure and loot one may gather. Since that's not something easily replaced by some magic sword you find laying around
another quandry was of classes that focus around a single element and how it may end up in rough patches against things that would resist it. I suppose that's a matter of having allies cover their weak spots, design to avoid such narrow attack avenues, or simplify things down to magical and physical damage with elements being flavor but that's awfully limiting
one setting concept is like isolated "worlds" drifting in a "Cosmic Sea" which is an ocean that looks all galaxy-y or something. Or just Floating Islands, those are always in vogue right?
So stats
The rolling from 3 to 18 is an artifact we‚Äôre used to but some people find confusing
This is new and not anchored by tradition
I also aim to not have any truly useless stats like Int seems to be so often in 5e
There‚Äôs been a temptation to merge int and wis, but as someone who understands the nuance between the two and love to see characters high in one and low in the other, I am loathe to do so
Since Races are rolled into class anyway I imagine you get a handy bump to relevant stats by default
I like the idea of tying race & class, I think it can provide for more flavorful classes and with subtypes/archetypes you can cover the typical class types
Exactly
hm
Is this fair play @timlives
Actual possibility
Yes
One thing I know I'll have. Piggy Merchants, cause Piggy Banks
looking through 4e and 5e to see what kind of out of combat features some classes get. The way 4e parses things is kind of confusing since I'm not familiar with it, but at the very least it does look like Rogue has some "powers" that are used out of combat, letting you re-roll a bluff check as an "encounter" ability
and most spells you use out of combat seem to be "rituals" instead of mixed together
gotta be an easier way to have some character customization than having an assload of moves on a list to choose from. Granted it is kind of neat to have things besides a basic slash to choose from, y'know
4e splits up your levels in 3 tiers from 1-30 and it seems you always have 2 "at-will powers" that are your basic things you can use every turn. You keep the same ones the entire time but are allowed to "retrain" them at points.

Utility powers seem to be a mix of combat or non-combat but basically are non damaging, you don't start with any at level 1, you get one at level 2 and you get a new one every 4 levels having 7 at max level

and you get daily (once per long rest) and encounter (once per short rest) powers until you cap at like 4, then you get the option to replace them, with your 4th encounter ability being gotten when you hit 11, and your 4th daily power at 20
and Feats are just every even number
but yeah it's mostly pulling attacks from a list, except sometimes you get non-hurting abilities that work just about the same
at any rate it seems like you never really gain any passive abilities other than starting Class Features
Rope? Lamp Oil? Bombs? You want it? it's yours my friend! as long as you have enough gems!
oing
:FrogChamp:
so Armor. in D&D as we know armor = AC which is the rate of if you take damage or not.
So Bulky Armored things rarely get hit, or rather in narrative they may be hit but not take damage.
what if that AC was merely "Evasion" and Heavier Armors could lower it, but also more damage reduction?
only downside there is you can't really have evasive armors unless they were enchanted, because really how do you improve on dodging and mobility than just being naked ( '^')v
I like it
You may not get evasive armors, but evasion should def. be a product of other skills like DEX.
Makes sense that you can train yourself to better D O D G E
and we know good ol 3rd edition had touch and flat footed ACs
and in those days the AC was an additive bonus, as opposed to 5e where it becomes the new base
3e also had dex limits on all armors, but was mostly inconsequential unless it was Heavy Armor  and some degrees of medium armor
and there were also "armor check penalties" applied to a handful of skills
lot of shit to remember
interestingly in 4e, which uses 3.x's Will, Fort, and Reflex saves still, Intelligence and Dex were both stats that went with Reflex, so having high Int meant you could still dodge things reliably even if your dex was lower
4e also had a good handful of abilities and powers that scaled with stats you wouldn't expect meaning dump stats were rarer
the Warlord actually is a Strength focused class that makes good use of Intelligence and Charisma, being a sort of battlefield tactician
man the Warlord is really cool actually. one of the "at-will" powers straight up has an ally attack someone and uses YOUR int mod as a bonus to damage
and another one does a kind of weak attack (it deals damage based on your str modifer alone, no dice roll) BUT you choose an ally and it gets a bonus to attack and damage on that same target based on your Cha modifier
okay one thing I was confused about that is explained way the hell later A basic ass attack is still available and valid
my studies in comparing and contrasting 5e to 4e have been fun. So far I Think the one bit of 4e actually throwing me off is the "Rituals" business for most spells
since a lot of other spells are "powers" which generally are attacks, but as I've now seen is not always the case
well generally all powers are attacks except utility powers which may or may not be combat focused
like Wizards can get Feather Fall as a utility power, that works as one would expect, but can only use it once per long rest, and it can be used whenever
I think a thing that might throw people off is how using skills to deal with shit in the environment is considered a "non combat encounter" so when it says "only encounters are important so just kind of vaguely describe moving from point A to point B" it basically means to lightly describe junk until you hit an important detail that actually requires rolls and thought
that couple with people being fussy about how they changed casters is probably why 4e was damned so harshly.
I'd need to play it myself and see
with that Int = Reflex mention it reminds me of in World of Darkness, initiative was always higher of dex or wits
Wizards can have AoE spells at level 1 as at-will abilities ( 'A')
the trade off is they get a lot of AoE and Debuffs but don't do a mega lot of damage and this made people upset
Fighter's get moves that change effects based on the type of weapon you're using
I feel like 5e‚Äôs archetypes may be the best route for class customization
Or something akin to Wakfu
Where classes had a set mechanic and 3 elemental sets of moves that focused on different things
There though the only thing keeping you from doing all 3 was efficiency and stat allocation
And grinding
Generally people stick to two
A criticism I‚Äôve seen for DnD is social interactions being bare bones
How does one make it more mechanical without being awkward?
Mechanical yet not awkward. That's hard.
The responsibility generally varies from DM to player group, and so does the "solution" yeah?
You _could_ study it and come up with a system that works.
You'd literally have to study human behavior and narrative structures (or just roll the dice).
Did you have an idea for a system that would help?
Nope
I know I don‚Äôt want it like Burning wheel where arguments play out like combat encounters
Really I don‚Äôt see much wrong with having a difficulty based in the person‚Äôs standing with you and it can sway based on your actions
But don‚Äôt allow rolls if they‚Äôre unneeded or if it‚Äôs impossible so someone can‚Äôt just bypass all logic with a lucky roll
So I've been rambling about a new tabletop system project thing, yeah?
I'm thinking as someone who loves to marry plot and mechanics together so much, and given my desire of having classes being very lore driven...I think it might help me focus if I decide what kind of world I'm dealing with

so doubling back from my rambling of another system
I've decided to scuttle back to my whack ass primal craftin and evolvin game
and I think I have enough bullshittery to try...actually making some playtest rules
THUS I'm undergoing my hardest ordeal yet: organizing my thoughts into a digestible format
also
I need to figure out how to organize the shit
michael's one shot got me in the mood to run a d&d campaign so if you two wanna play lemme know @Koala @Mujin
here's my intro/hook write up so y'all can brew up some characters early :
Your party will be a team of adventurers investigating the ruins of an ancient city long thought lost(think like atlantis but undermountain instead of underwater). Mysterious and rumored to be filled with riches, you will not be the only adventurers here. We'll talk about why exactly everyone is here and where everyone is from during session zero when I have factions built and a map made but if you wanna play start thinking of a character that would have some interest or stake in investigating this ruined city. This campaign is starting at level 1 and I wanna take it at least through like level 12, though we might go further. Prefer no one brings an evil character initially, if you really wanna play one we'll work something out or they can come in later.
oh for you two that weren't in the call earlier this story is related to the book im trying to write, its the same setting but set in an earlier era. Won't be any author/dm railroading syndrome but part of this is me wanting to flesh out some history of the world im trying to build
voila channel made, lore dumped, ill be around all day trying to reset my sleep schedule awaiting questions and feedback
:worryStareLick:
:wow:
:gachiBASS:
*Our-Phistopheles*
I can be a halfling with a +1 con making the penalty -2 instead of 3
and be a tiny sickly halfling caster and no one can hurt me because they'd feel too guilty
Bandits attack
*tiny cough*
"aw. Don't feel bad miss, here you can have this wallet, buy some nice food"
Michael: That's *my* wallet
I have considered being a cavalier at some point, thinking being a smoll person riding on a thing (since it is less confusing that figuring out where I am on a large creature) I assume we'd be in a spot where riding around on things won't be a hindrance
Given how theologically driven the setting is, and how most casters are glared at, it makes sense for there to be a lot of divine casters, but at the same time as a party comp I gotta wonder how much is too much (v'^')v
is themeing good? should I diversify our portfolio?
then again while the location is of religious significance I think we're in neutral territories and are basically given a free pass to be a bit heretical to get the job done..
hm
what is the possibility of me being a necromancer?
you ready to pull up your big boy britches and be a wizard?
necromancer odds are really low but not impossible
and jared this is a world where divine entities and powers are very very real and tangible, especially in contrast to how few other sources of 'power' there are. The road of faith is easy and bountiful but also represents the 'system' so to speak. The man, or woman in this case, ain't gonna bring me down and personally I'd never play a divine class in this setting because i prefer more rebelious characters. tho the origins of the dreaming goddess and the blending of myth and truth in a setting of magic and real gods are themes i want to explore. Theology is very important to the setting like you said but whether its important to your characters just depends on where you wanna start on this spiritual scale. Hard to be atheistic when real gods slap the shit out of you. And for the faithful well, what do you do when  your theology differs from reality. Some of this will be more apparent after the first few sessions when i can express more of the tone im going for
hope that helps
my brain is homing in on a few concepts
this is d&d afterall so the beauty of it will be whatever coolness you guys bring to the table and where it interacts with the themes i wanna present
i can try to extrapolate more if you need me to, always hard to tell how coherently im transcribing something from my brain
I get what you mean
I think I try really hard to adhere with what works with the setting first before I attempt to subvert things
like in that brief Bonswan game you did, It was very obvious we were part of a rude ass cruel privileged government and were probably expected to question that and not be irredeemable monsters in the face of logic, but we weren't, we did our jobs ( '^')v
over time my character probably would have got sickened or disillusioned by it, but at that moment that was all she knew
yeah that story i wanted to present some shittines in the world and see what you guys wanted to do about it over time
and also I guess when I see someone's homebrew I do my best to respect the structure and rulings they bring forth and try to be creative within the boundaries. Dunno, always strikes me as weird when I bring up entirely new ideas, and rather than exploring what makes a race what they are people immediately act to subvert expectations...before even building expectations
though given this is still mostly a D&D world that's less of an issue
i tried to leave room for all walks of life, for example if charles really wanted to play a necromancer theres room for an origin story in Qurg or as a Lorixian exile or even if he wanted  to be from Ifen and his origin story was theres a secret order of necromancer planning to seize control of the church from the shadows then bang thats whats happening. I love letting PCs set the foundation for a faction for example i wasnt entirely sure what i wanted to do with Yten but Bolton's scholar helped me establish that this is a place of knowledge and study tho that study is crippled by tradition and prejudice
same goes for mikes monk its gonna help me find the foundation for what the hell is going on over in Apora
basically i dont really hold any of this lore as more than a loose framework meant to fit around whatever we need for the story and besides a few set piece characters and events theres nothing i really deem as sacred and immutable
I think my current ideas are
-Aasimar Divine Soul Sorc Ara Ara Mom
-flip the script and be Fallen Aasimar Shadow Sorc Big Tiddy Goth GF
-Shy Awkward Halfling Bug-rider from Ebreth, who due to being on the lower caste is horrible with people, but has a fondness for animals.
-an Eladrin Martial class (likely a Rogue) from Qurg
-maaaaybe a serious lady knight (I've been watching a Xenoblade 2 LP and Morag's on the brain)
1 is basically mini version of the goddess, youd be very popular everywhere. 2 is my personal shameless favorite, 3 is fun idea but i think this table has plenty of shy and awkward already, for 4 i think Qurg is fucking awesome and i hope at least someone plays a Qurg. 5 is fine of course but needs more development
about my same sentiments
honestly I would lean most towards 1 or 2 I think this group very well needs some sort of conscious that keeps them honest and pulls up their reputation or altneratively if you choose the shadow sorc this party will definitely have a lot of "the world is against us" vibes and you'll find a lot of closed doors to bust down, at least socially
1 has some good pairing potential too like you're from Ifen and of pretty good social status so much that paladin charles was sent as your personal bodyguard, or something similar
if of course charles wants to play a pally
me when jared makes art for our D&D chars
What would a necromancer for plants and trees be called?
necrobotanist
:POGGERS:
what do you even wanna do as a plant necromancer
do you make zombies out of plants
are you just a farmer thats really bad at letting go
join vc and ill tell ya my ideas
So what‚Äôs Chuck got in mind since I can‚Äôt hop in VC
If he still wants to be a Necrobotanisr there‚Äôs the Circle of Spores Druid
uhhhhhhhh
I was _in_ this call when they were doing this but I forgot.
he made a paladin
There's also a new druid subclass called the Circle of Spores that's centered around decay and gets Animate Dead too. It's actually incredible mechanically too.
I saaaaaaaid that, but not in as much detail
Oh shiiiid I didn't see
Yea I changed it to paladin because I'm still new to DnD and I don't wanna ruin my experience by playing something way too complicated for my level.
a lot of new peeps struggle with spellcasting
it's not *super* complicated but it does require some extra work
some rules to it aren't as obvious as they should be, and some things are just kinda weird
like, some spells are labeled as needing material components, but you don't really need the specific material if you have, like a staff or something, but there is a material pouch item...that also just has anything you may need
unless it explicitly states you need a material that is a jewel worth a certain amount
would have been easier just to say it has a Focus component or something
also some spells are bonus actions, but you can't use a spell as an action and a bonus action on the same turn, unless it's a cantrip (level-0 spells you have infinite uses of)
and some classes require you to prepare spells, meaning you select a handful from a list of all the spells you know every long rest to have access to that day. This is sometimes a pain for Clerics and Druids because they know EVERY SPELL they have access too (we usually just write down the ones we know we'll actually use)
Sorcerers don't have to deal with that bullshit, at the cost of utility
and Warlocks....they have a completely different way of using their spells
:peepoBlurry:
I'm totally down to play a slutty monk
Did you all end up doing anything last night with character planning?
Heck no.
no but we can do it today if you want
Jared got blazed and drunk, and I simply got blazed, then we played Overwatch.

What
Now that one I understand
Isn't that, like, half of what people post as art on tumblr?
no half the artists on tumblr do "fixed" versions of anime characters where they are no longer "white" (despite being japanese)
...and then they gender bend them
*cough*
_hack wheeze_
[*coughs in spanish*]
but yeah no Tumblr "headcanoning" characters as trans becasue they don't fit a gender role is ass backwards as FUCK
Is that the Third Arm Sash from Xiaolin Showdown?
more or less really
That show was awesome
Ah, tumblr, where characters that don't fit gender roles are thereby "trans" in order to shoehorn them into opposite gender roles
And same sex characters are clearly homosexual for each other
This is kinda getting side tracked but I found it applicable
like I'm all for more representation, but they try to hard to find things, and they gotta reeeeeeeach
and throw a hissy fit if you accidentaly do something racist by not following their racist doctrine
like not understanding that lighting makes skin look lighter even if you have dark skin
or that villains do bad things, and that does not mean the person who drew it condones that
and that you don't need a trigger warnign for pomegranites
I still lose my shit every time I see someone tag literally any drawing or photo with Scopophobia
If I was actually at my desk my head would be through it I'd headdesk so hard
I wrote a thing to summarize Mystics so that I would better grasp them myself.
@Demi Tarot @timlives ^^^
Not to mention that this kinda shit actually trivializes actual mental issues to the point that it makes things more difficult for people that actually suffer

Short, raven, side-swept hair fall upon an lightly oaken face. The dark-skinned creature, despite the slight limp, moves with a purpose -- then stubs his toes on a barrel and retaliates against the world by glaring at that damn barrel.

That's great.
of the 8 schools of magic in DnD, which would you say is the "English Major"
I'd say Divination or Illusion
wait no Illusion would be any of the creative arts majors
most likely theater
either could work. this character I'm making for a one shot is pretty much a fresh out of wizard school elf wizard who can't land a job
Lol I'd say go with Illusion, you probably have more stuff to work with for the lols
be part of whatever the fuck a wizard school interpretive dance theater group would be

If you're not back by 9 im cancelling the game
he'll fuckin do it
Justine walking back to the bar?
it's doomfist
Ooooh neeeeaaaaat.
Y'know, I swear I was still mentally there, and coherent, and I *still* dunno how we got into the Squirrel argument
It was probably because I was drunk and couldn't get my point across in a good way lol
let's never do that again
I mean it was hilarious, and I was still coherent, but mom told me I was being too loud becaue I was trying to talk over you guys ( .v.)
It started as the characters arguing over why they were helping a bunch of squirrels and devolved into a mess of arguing in and out of character due to intoxication, being cross-faded, and fatigue
Yeah, let's go back to having sessions on Saturday
y'all are WEAK
I had been awake for 20 hours by the end of last night :/
Work exhausts me simply with the hours
HEH.
sure lets go with that

good job Jurd
@here Hey guys check out all this progress I've made on my sick new resume:
Wellp, time to delete it.
now just have some small text in the middle that says "I do it"
And by that, you _did_ mean just delete it and then stare at an empty Photoshop file again, right?
oh shit your name is actually manpreet
Ain't that some shit, aye?
not gonna lie when I call you manpreet sometimes that's just a joking guess
Congrats. You figured out that when I said my name is the "John Smith" of Indian I _wasn't_ kidding.
I don't remember that
but yeah
It could only get more stereotypical is if your last name was Singh-Patel
Ahuehauha. That would be breaking a few conventions, actually.
Like combining "Johnson" with "Richardson" and making "Richardjohnson".
Smith-Johnson
Singh-Patel
well
according to American/western hyphenating conventions
Fair enough.
@Demi Tarot @Koala Wanna fug a dug in Dug Gayme?
@Demi Tarot @sk Either of you? Duck Game?
need more slep
Aye. We played some and stopped anyway.
Save some energy then go to bed later.
Take two. I feel like I'm reaching into Mike's resume too much.
Did you know I had two Mike's Hard Lemonades left from the 6-pack I got last Friday?
@Mujin @timlives @Koala Its not my CPU! My CPU temperature is fine! The fucking chipset is 127C right now!
I can't tell if that's a gross miscalculation or not, but I touched the tip of my finger to the chipset and had I instantly recoiled from its heat...
I think I need to move my GPU to a different slot, or get a chipset cooling block lel.
Okay. Nevermind. I'm confused.
My CPU temperature is still fine, but the temperature that I _thought_ was the CPU is actually just switching between 127-8C and -127-8C.
I think that's just misreads.
I'm confused.
Fucking computers, man.
hi
Wtf your mobo is overheating?
I got a fannie pack from syfy
it makes me cooler
@Koala Yep.
For some odd reason the two big fans in the front of the case are apparently not cutting it.
I'm assuming.
My computer crashed the moment I opened up Overwatch twice, my CPU and GPU temps. were fine, and my drivers are up to date.
The only thing particularly "hot" in my PC was the chipset.
Yeah, my CPU and GPU are both around 46C rn in-game.
That's gotta be a bigger problem than just the fans not cutting it
#it'safanthing
is your computer dust free
Yep.
Bah! idc.
I still plan to buy a new mobo, CPU and case soon anyways.
Except, ya' know, need this "job" thing first.
Lame.

The direction I've ended up going so far. ^
Sick curves.
@Mujin @timlives
Thoughts?
@mannie.exe I feel like it would benefit a lot from expanding the white space both more to the top and to the left. I would also make sure to add Rainy Day Media as another bit of experience. Once you expand the white space a little bit, it will help you fit that all in. Overall, looks awesome!
I can give a business student's perspective on it in a few
But yeah, expand the usable white space to create more room to put more experience
Gotcha.
I'll show you my resume as well
I'm not certain about what I wanna do with the profile section. I feel like I've seen more examples of people just using it as a short introduction, but @sk suggests I do more with it somehow.
I'd say short intro
Because a hiring mgr doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading
Should I make it less personal or non-relevant to the field of work than it is right now?
It should be to the point about what kind of work you want to do and your goals regarding your work
Gotcha.
is there a joke here
Nope.
No joke.
Just the Moby.
Yes
Our lives
nonono jokes are funny
No, they have to exist first to count.
It's dark humor
dark humor is still funny
@Demi Tarot OVERWATCH?
no sankyu
oke
no I wouldn't add to it
I would reduce it
I think my intro section is one sentence
and I have limited prose except in the experience section
@mannie.exe
I would expand on your iron yard studd
@Mujin Finished the other assessment as well! Yaaaay!
Just to get tabs on things, who all wants to be a part in the one shot I'm putting together?
@Demi Tarot? Still interested in that one shot with @Mujin?
o?
o/
I now @timlives was considering it as he wants to play as well.
Yay! That's at least two people as of now, @Mujin. Stephan and I.
Cool! I've got some good ideas now so I can actually talk to you all about making your characters now lol
Schweet!
ye
get schweety
@here Who wants to _DIE_?
@Koala @Demi Tarot @sk Yes?
workk
I have to visit a lawyer later too
then maybe trivia night and drinking
wot why do you have a to visit a lawyer
did sk do a drug?
I feel like I have acute deathitis
I'm not super keen on the whole dying part, but yeah
I love when discord posts things twice when you d/c
edited goat people to not have goat genitals

shit broke, good sign that my OW quota for the day is over
fucking Austrailia
oi you wanna fight cunt
Wow that's quite Australian.
I think.
I'm glad.
Actually, that's pretty much what that girl told me. @Demi Tarot @Koala @Mujin
Oh sheet
Maybe she just wants to bang

DOOMFIST TODAY MOTHERFUCKERS
pick a power
I already have absorb bad luck
I just cashed in my $40 Blizzard balance for 50 Overwatch lootboxes now that the reduced duplicate update is out.
Too bad my entire computer crashes each time I launch Overwatch.
I don't think its an overheating issue anymore. @Koala @timlives
ri[
rip
@Mujin LET'S GO.
@Demi Tarot @Koala You guys interested in some _PLAY_?
I guuuuuuuuuuess
this sums up my mental state
10/10
That was a great trip.
Thank you.
we DnDoodling tonight?
Can't tonight
alrighty then, did Mike ever say anthing else about the oneshot, I remember him wanting to talk about it before but I was asleep
Soon ¬Æ
Yeah I was under the assumption we wouldn't be doing it tonight since @Koala said he couldn't the last session.
are you sassing me
Uh, I don't think so.
But he is assing you
I _don't_ thiiiink so.
@here Bigglesnatch?
*ur* a bigglesnatch
let me food
@Demi Tarot Where'd you go?
I disconnected before I even got the game open. I'm just gonna take the hint.
That's fair.
these have gotten too meta
what the fuck
I'm watching Miss Kobiyashi's Amine Dragon Toddy with my gf
gay
Ikr
@here are we doing the thing?
do you hate cute boys
I thought we didn't do Saturndays because NuMike was with Lady Jadey
Yeah I think @Mujin's busy.
Not sure.
Update? @Mujin
I want @Koala  to know every normal npc from here on out is going to be a cute boy
step up from every lesbian being a manly amazon ( '^')
there was one
techncially two but only one did anything theo ther remained a background character.
and the other one was straight just major role reversal
unless she was a beard
but this place seems progressive enough for that to not be necessary
fun fact: no one rolled high enough to preceve that the air is in fact densely packed lesbians
tfw sexuality is physical in form
and is a building block of matter
Yeah pretty sure its a no-go for tonight.
damn
you guy don't get to encounter the gay squrriels tonight
GREAT.
god, why continue living
10/10
Grand.
wow what a god
Idea: Smooth Criminal, but all instances of "Annie" are replaced with Rick saying "Morty"
YES.
apart from just the name of the server, I always imagine this as the background music of this place
The entire OST for sure, but maybe Lost Painting in particular since its got that **deep ambience**.
I mean in particular Marble Gallery seems to fit a bunch of jackasses just sitting around talking about dumb shit in some weird castle
I don't like to think of it that way unless Michael is around.
Quality text.
Wellp. Time to get buzzed and play platformers.
Ahh that's great.
y'know we've talked about it hither and yon, but why have we never straight up did a Dark Souls n' Dragons thing?
or something with a similar feel
We did
It was called Nechronica
Lol
you didn't play Nechronica
Besides, Nechronica is hardly Dark Souls n' Dragons.
@Mujin @Demi Tarot @Koala
OVER
WAAAAAAAATCH?
_ye?_
sho
I can later
nevermind it won't let me log in now
I can hear you fiiiine.
@Demi Tarot
Well idc, you might've DC'd now.
Been awfully quiet.
yeah
okay so as it is what it is, Telduria is a Fridizzle endeavour, yeah? Though, the amount of times per month we can playificate it is limited to when Stephan of House Koalawalladingdong is available, so effectively a couple of times a month? correct?
probaly
so on the days of Saturn, who is avail with minimal fail?
probaly you
( '^') no shite ya dingus, why you think I'm askin
( 'A')-üó° YOU WANNA GET CUT?
( '^')o *ahem*
I was chomped by the DM bug, probably fatal, but as I wither and die I desire to be the master of fate ( '^')/
I can do the Saturn for a few weeks
then to you 3ple people. What do you desire?
a better life, not to be sad all the time, to feel like I can feel again
How about escapism?
good enough
what flavor, power metal, radioactive fallout, or dead girl?
Power metal is good, but radioactive fallout sounds tempting. Then again i like dead girls. I guess I play what ever everyone else want to
everyone else s( '^')v
fuck
where did they go ( '^')
ded
is there a way to make my computer not make like a gig of memory dump files in the span of a few days?
probaly
all the info I see is all like "it memory dumps on a crash, and you can turn that off" but CCleaner is all like "if you clean your drive you can get rid of a GB of space" and its all form memory dump files, soooo, I don't remember crashing
I'm not sure what would be causing that
Windows 10 being Windows 10 probably
yah
like 7 and 8 were fine, but 10 is like "Y'know that stuff that worked fine in everything else and were jsut kind of established as the status quo of how computers worked?"
"Yes?"
( 'w')-[O]] *Delete*
My Computer is now called This Computer for no reason, and its not even readily accessible from the friggin' start menu, I gotta search for it
and don't get me started on Cortana
what the hell
yeah the Start menu is now like....mostly ads
damn
When your DM takes the Random in the Random Encounter Chart too far
Mannie the man man man
sup
do you have a vote for game
Power metal or radioactive fallout.
I vote radiout fallactive
Apopalypse it is

Mannie I think I caught your Wanna Dietis
Great.
Except, like, not.
also Stephy Nicks, we were considering keeping the setting, but swapping systems to Fate to allow some more flexibility. that cool wit'chu?
Fate?
Eh, sure?
Do I still get to shoot things and speak like a good ol boy?
yes
Deal.
though to properly complete the Character Creation process I need you all to unite

Today I saw Big Guy
GUESS WHERE I SAW HIM MICHAEL
The cosmetics section of the Wal-Mart?
yup
Being retarded but not retarded enough?
so I made small talk, and mom was like " I'll go on ahead and you can stay and talk a bit."
and so I was like [Top 10 anime betrayls]
Rip
Did he start talking about league
actually no, just that he hardly gets on the internet anymore and that he managed to get a raise. wasn't all that unpleasant to be honest, still got out of there as soon as I found a smooth break because his manager swooped by and I didn't want to get him in trouble for making small talk
had to explain to mom "you know how every group of people has that one guy that you have to add "bless his heart" ot the end of every story about him? That was ours."
MY SIDES
yep big guy makes more than me now
*slurping noises*
againskies, what's our RPG situation looking like this weekend so I know if we're running D&D or Fate
I'm down to dizzle
I'm free
"AHHHHHHHHHHHH"
WHAT ARE WE DOING
üî´-('A' ) IF I DON'T GET ANSWERS I'LL START SHOOTING
Well I presume we're doing Telduria tomorrow night? @timlives
@here everyone on board with that?
So tonight we could do Fate?
Yeah
NO. No Fate from me. I'm busy.
I could do Telduria tomorrow or tonight, but another session would be too much right now.

Can you please stop narrating my life?
said Mannie, clearly frustrated.
as he read the words he was mildly unerved that they were predicitng his every move, like the fact he was touching his face. He reels back in surprise.
Nah. That's didn't hit at all!
But hey, remember this?!
THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST
Except, I didn't hear this for the first time until a few months ago.
So this is like, supa' new to me.
I feel legitimately upset about that for no reason.
what would you do if you were walking alone in the fog and you jsut hear this getting louder in the distance.
It's a hot beat.
But holy fuck are the verses confusing me...
I was hoping my hopping in and Senitnal Slashing the Blink Dog would be this
LOL
what is Telduria status. Fried, Sadder, or nun
nunn I'm going back to nku the 19th
aight
How does that jacket even work
like any other jacket, I just fucked up the torso proportions so she's leaning back a bit. I was having an off art day and this was the only half decent thing to come out after 5 attempts
Still like good ( '^')-b
*looks
I like it
I did have another idea, but partway through I was like "that idea seemed familiar, and realized it was this character's outfit
She looks like a pokemon character found a samurai sword
well a few drawings down she is actualyl dressed like a pokemon trainer
Huh I didn't expect that
another modern Patti I did was the one with Wisteria and Seraphine, where she was just casual-style with an oversized jersey
but this combo.
Yup. Time for bed
Lol
hi

aslfjasl;kfjawsklngb;aebawrvawrfbawibwqzedxr ghb
I won't have a car tomorrow, otherwise we were also considering Friday night as a possibility.
wouldn't lack of car increase playability as you don't leave house?
fug
my fug didn't send properly
so much for the updated wi fi drivers
No, as I have to pick up @timlives from NKU and bring him here for the session.
Can't do that on Friday as my mom doesn't get back from work until after 2200, and Saturday's a no-go as well.
Maybe next weekend~
@timlives jk i'm over here
@Mujin @Demi Tarot @Koala D&D tomorrow? I can pick Micahel up.
I'm freer

I'm being assaulted by a college
yell "that's my purse i don't know you" and kick it in the balls
Ok
@timlives
rip did i miss everyone
idk
this hurts
To say the least
so that play. I sat in my school's theater hall in the dark for like 2 hours before I decided to look up the poster on my kindle and see that it was being presented the next town over so I ran screaming to my car to get over there in 30 minutes ( ' w ' )
but I made it and FINALLY SAW THE ENDING TO TWELVE ANGRY MEN AFTER LIKE 8 YEARS
EXCEPT NOT AS A MOVIE
AND THERE WERE GIRLS THIS TIME SO THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE NAME
I'm confused.
the play was Twelve Angry Jurors
based off the movie Twelve Angry Men
I saw the movie in Psychology class in high school but we left before the ending
Now I seen it
THE PROPHECY
I mean, hey that's pretty good.
Didja' like it?
ye
the college experience
I bought dis
Oooh cool
I wanted one without a numpad but oh well
Why no numpad
I love numpad
disgusting for fitting on desk
This is the one I bought for my build
Got it from the uni bookstore for MULAA
lol nice
Had a ton that I never used lol
also my cec 101 prof finally graded everyhing
every assignment has an average below 50% lol
Dafaq
That's CEC 10 fucking 1
also we were supposed to attend 1 event like guest lecture or college picnic or something and write a two page report on it
did not attend one, did turn in paper

I wouldn't
Kek lol is his natural educational habitat

Yeah that's the last step before beginning onboarding.
1/3-4.
nice gl
Nice Mannie
Good luck!
Woooo!!!! Awesome job ManFriendo!!!
doing finance homework, got most of it done but my brain is hitching on one simple algebraic thing. Assuming I mathed right before hand.
13.95%=(Wd7.15%)+(We15.65%)
and naturally Wd+We=1 since I'm dealith with percentages
I need to find Wd, but to do so I also need to find We
also of note Wd+We=1 becaue percentages
like I'mma run through my THOT process here and you guys tell me if I make an error in judgement
13.95-(We‚Ä¢15.65) =Wd ‚Ä¢ 7.15

13.95/7.15 (We/7.15)‚Ä¢(15.65/7.15) = Wd
1.95 - (We/7.15)*2.19 = Wd
now
1.95/2.19 - (We/2.19)‚Ä¢7.15/2.19 = Wd/2.19
0.89- (We/2.19) ‚Ä¢ 3.26 = Wd/2.19
not only do I think I'm wring but I think I'm also spiraling into a feedback loop of stupid
BUT LET'S KEEP GOING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
but first let's back up a second
on that last one
1.95 - (we‚Ä¢15.65)/7.15 = Wd is more accurate, isn't it?
my brain says isolate the variables, but I know if the variables are on the same side that'll jsut be a 1
fuuuuuuck
idk how2math but somebody else @here might, ayyyy?
13.95/7.15 - (We*15.65)/7.15 = Wd
I don't think you divide both We and  then 15.65 separately?
It's been a long time since I did math tho

"If your mindset is like, "I'm going to screw with the world and bring it all down!" And you have that kind of mischievous attitude, like you're messing with people, or like it's a prank when you're aspiring to create manga, then I think that'd be pretty interesting, wouldn't it?" -Urasawa Naoki
All you really need to know from that video, but still.
Updated my background slideshow

no thanks
My second interview got pushed to Wednesday, and I quote, "we'll be getting more people together for your interview, since yours is a lead position."
Ah... the formalities of gauging...
they're going to make you fight the other canadates
DEATH BAAAATTLLLLLE
HELLO
@mannie.exe  Oh there is level 60 job gear
@a ghost with purpose I was once capable of being pissed, then I watched this video.
Guys, I was browsing /b and found a thing
Black Micheal and Goth Stephan find something stupid in the jungle
@a ghost with purpose @timlives @Demi Tarot `125.74MB` large update for FFXIV released today.
I think I'm gonna pull a you, and pick up Astrologian alongside Samurai.
@a ghost with purpose
Wheeeeeee
Believe in the heart of the cards
tired
make this have never happened
@Koala I reject.
THAT
IS
HERESY
@Deleted User ay
do you need the expansions to play Arma nowadays
@a ghost with purpose given any thought to Destiny 2?
just curious
@timlives
And not a single one of them is wearing a shirt
which leads me to assume that shirts don't exist in russia
only track suit tops
Yes, of course.
@Koala  it looks decent, but i probably wont buy it
not sure it has anything going for other than well polished and good graphics
I'm also interested to see what Anthem does...
I have wanted to play Destiny and that other game for a while -- don't remember its name.
@a ghost with purpose ditto
JK THE INTERVIEW DATE WAS CHANGED YESTERDAY TO TOMORROW, AND I ONLY NOW CHECKED IT.
I also never got an update for it, so I called to confirm it was today or not, and as it turns out, it wasn't.
I also have another interview tomorrow now. Back to back.
This should be fun.
@Koala
these gl1tch tr1x got me all riled up
YA YA YA COCO JAMBO YA YA YE
@Koala  new wolfenstein seems like a must buy
amazing so far
Oh dang.
Now look what you did... @Demi Tarot
holy fuck the opening sequence is so good
@a ghost with purpose I've got it pre-loaded
watching an early access stream now
I'm not gonna do anything til release
wanna take it allll in
ya dont
its too good to spoil if you wanna play
I saw gameplay of the wheelchair bit in the sub a month or two ago
all the hype I need my man
but the context
Oh I know the context
I played The New Order
no no no
you will understand
I will on Friday
tomorrow is the Mortal Empires update for TW Warhammer II
I can't wait to kill Nazis tho
im impressed they decided not to include multiplayer
so that they could focus on the singleplayer
I'm not _impressed_
Just happy that they know their priorities with Wolfenstein
its impressive that they've got the nerve to do it
id assume publishers are scared of releasing singleplayer only games
but a high quality story well worth it instead of some shitty firefight or tdm
Well the devs established their abilities to craft a great story and a great singleplayer only game with TNO and the New Blood
And the sales backed them up
And Bethesda's the publisher
They don't really publish a lot of multiplayer games
I mean, DOOM has multiplayer but it was a flop, ESO is meh, and Quake Champions is _okay_, but that's all Besthesda/Zenimax really has offered as titles with multiplayer
such QoL improvements
welding not aids, manual saves
neat
how about the jontron
ur a jontron
**BANG**>üî´-('^' )

I'm scared.
That has been in my recommended since it came out two days ago.
I just now acquired the sanity to watch it.
It's quite a trip
.
hoho! yesss
Also, I have _three_ interviews today now...
J.P. Morgan Chase's tech. lead from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM, Myriad Genetics from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM, and Callibrity from 4:45 PM to ??? PM...
Help...
Wooooohoooo
I'm applying to JP morgan for an internship this summer
congrats @mannie.exe

Who knows, you might be able to use me as a reference. ‚îê(¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ)‚îå
One down, two to go.
That was the easiest interview of my life. 10/10. Nailed it.
yee
Just sat through three light cycles cuz this big rig wanted to make an illegal u turn
Lul
I'm mad
@mannie.exe did your interview of yesterday get pushed back?
To today, yeah. Had it earlier. Went amazing!
Then there was another one right after, which went really well as well!
The last one for today is at ~~5:30~~. (jk it was 4:45)
@timlives @a ghost with purpose LET'S GO
**_HE LOOKS SO BISSED OFF BROH_**
>:C
I've played AUra Kingdom before
a while ago
its garb
Yeah I was but jesting.
@Mujin @a ghost with purpose @Demi Tarot This is what you do to me.
I got da high score
eurotruck simulator 2 is 75% off right now
...tempting
Dying Light Following Edition is 60% off if anyone wants to play it with me
also Zombie Army Trilogy is 80% off and KF2 is 50% off
most of us own zombie army trilogy i believe
I'm thinking about dying light
Ahhh... Dying Light.
I remember playing a bit of it around the second time we did a Stars Without Numbers campaign. Pretty fun.
Still haven't bought it yet...
We own Zombie Army. We all got it and then played for like 2 hours and had a blast
actually we killed hitler
oh
steam://openurl_external/
AHHH!
I wanna play Origins! :c
Though I think I'll just wait for half a year and play it after all of the typical Ubisoft patches are released.
What could go wrong? I'm sure it'll be fiiiiiine
Depends. Are you a fan of transcending the feeble limitations of space through the means of glitches? If so, I'm sure you'd _love_ it.
@timlives @Koala ^
@mannie what are your people doing
pt 2
pt III
The finale of this epic tale
@mannie.exe  sry if i just logged u out of steam
Oh no you're fine. I quit on my own after a couple missions.
hey guys what torrent do you all use? like if im downloading something on piratebay what torrent do you extract with?
nvm i just downloaded utorrent
gross
stealing is wrong
@Koala warhammer is gud game
Ye
@Deleted User utorrent 2.2.1 specifically
The last version before it turned into a bloated piece o shite
man
man
bumping up to hard difficulty was good decision
cant just auto battle win everything lul
lol
playing WH II rite?
yep
doing the first high elf campaign atm
High Elves are neato I really like the faction flavor
Influence is neat
yeah
Lothern Sea Guard are like the best unit they have
they're weird
but gud
have to turn off skirmish mode for them to do what i want lol
Yeah
was using them to cover flanks for my spears and they kept running
like wtf
cmon man get in there
Yeah that's the only lil hiccup
Know what's also neato tho
Dargons
lots of Dargones
ya i just got the dragon building
many Dargoones
is one better than the other
Higher tier dragons lose Speed but have higher Health and Armor, iirc
oh i mean between moon vs sun dragons
same thing between Sun -> Moon
sun has more speed than moon
but less armor and health
I think there's some difference bw melee attack and defense stats too
do you  know if your main lord can die in battle?
Legendary Lords can only be wounded
You're talking about the immortality skill, right?
idk
just the hero you  start out with
lord sorry
not hero
Tyrion, as a legendary lord, can't die. Just can be wounded and unusable for a few turns
mkay thats good
Regular lords can die. Legendaries like Tyrion, Teclis, Malekith, Mazdamundi, etc cannot
fking skaelding
hohohohohohohohoho

Well, TCS/JPMC sent the offer letter. I should receive it in 24-48 hours.
Callibrity is also speeding up.
"glad to know the whole class is on thot patrol"

tfw my salary with TCS is actually 90k, but Enterprise Solutions is taking a 5k cut.
Still set with 85k. No rugrats.
Hot diggity DAMN
Holy shit my dude
Be my sugar daddy pls
Jk open a 401k

401k is among the benefits, actually.

they'll probably match everything you put in upto a certain percentage
lol
max that shit
Interesting
pretty standard benefits
the 401k matching seems a little low to me, but idk much about that
Just don't fuck it up whatever you do
^Yeah that
especially that
but I trust mannie
Don't do that
trust mannie?
or the fucking up bit?
must employ peer pressure positively
No trusting
lol
sorry mannmann andru says no trust
Also we should make a doki doki literature club channel and write our own poetry
with or without suicide
I like my friends alive
Add to your own taste

Oh, on the topic of me fucking up at my work, there's always the possibility that my dreams might come true instead. You know, then one where I show up to my work, trade or educational establishment without any sort of trousers.
Just to be clear I don't think you'll fuck up Mannie
But just to be safe, don't fuck up. No pressure.
I don't feel like I'll fuck up with or at my work either. Though I _am_ however, quite paranoid that I'll get super depressed over my parents again or something dumb will happen to the car(s).
Bah, I'll just need to be better, I s'pose.
One step at a time, my dude
Indeed.
This is an awesome new step you're taking, mate
Ohhh. I remembered something random. I think I was speaking to some recruiter quite a long while ago, and I think I said, "Duly noted." to him. And he was like, "Aww you ain't gotta talk like that." and something about something or other, then I was like, "Ah. I usually speak like that." Then we both let out a sensible chuckle, and that was the end of it.

starting to get those mannielocks
Mannielocks and the 3 Big Guys
Mannielocks was traveling through the woods, but got tired of that nature shit and broke into an empty house.
Mannielocks was hungry as fuck and saw 3 buckets of fried chicken. Hell Yeah. So he went and gobbled that shit down. "This bucket is too shook." He said of the first, so he tried the 2nd. "Also too shook." the 3rd. "God damn son, this chicken is more shook than I was at the end of Doki Doki Lit Club. I gotta sit down."

Mannielocks stumbles into the living room and takes a seat but it's hard and cold. "This chair is too bronze." He goes to another. "This chair is also too bronze." He goes to the third seat, covered in a blanket, he tosses it aside to see it was 3 bronze chairs stacked upon one another. "Bronze. Five Bronze Chairs....Fuck this I'm going to bed."

Mannielocks goes upstairs and sees 3 beds suspended from the cieling. "Yeah I ain't touchin' this one. I'm out."
and so Mannielocks went elsewhere.
I don't claim to know a lot _of_ people or a lot _about_ people, however, out of the numerous iterations of teachers, students, peers, and random hobos I've had the (dis)pleasure of encountering, none have affected me on such a personal level as Jared. There are days when I close my eyes and attempt to reflect upon my conscious being wound among the wavicles of Totality, and all I see is "( '^')", to which I always respond by feeling a little "( '^')-b".

you make everything expensive, you make credit gains peanuts, then you put a limit on them with MULTIPLE HOUR LONG cooldowns
and they have the gall to be pissed
when they're called out on it
like, it probably is a good game, with all this love and effort put into it, and you just shit on it, because no one wants to buy it now (-'^')-
god, I feel sorry for the actual developers
It's not like DICE is squeaky clean and innocent tho
Since the destruction on BF3 is a lot less than BC2 and somehow touted as better
and it's just gotten less and less, which sucks
I mean like, animators, artists, sound design, all this hard work on something a lot of people really fucking love
and it's jsut like, some marketing dickwad at EA dropped a deuce on it and are like "don't judge the salad by the shit, jsut scrape it off or eat around it." and the players are like "we ain't got time for this shit"
Why is no one eating this shit salad? do they even cook?
I mean its got Lettuce stolen from fairy gardens, tomatoes genetically engineered to feel your brain with endorphins akin to childhood nostalgia, and the ranch has a state of the at chemical that finally makes your brain release proper amounts of serotonin again, BUT THERE IS A WET SEMI-LIQUID SHIT STAIN IN THE MIDDLE (-'A')-
no one is gonna eat that
It's kinda like they took a really nice bowl, filled it with diarrhea, then tried out ladle it out onto your plate.
When we complained, they just got a smaller spoon.
on another note
I slept normie hours, this is bullshit
does it work
gotta do Personal Finance work/discussion board and a bit of the paper, clean my room a bit and go carry hay later. I'm already exhausted
I feel like the only times I enjoy myself and can work on my stuff is late nights, and I slept through it

my class actually got cancelled today
nice
*Nice*
So I'm thinking about investing in some cryptocurrencies as a fun experiment
Hrmmm
Or maybe trying to mine some ethereum or litecoins or some shit with my PC while I'm away at class
or both
We're talking about Blockchain and stuff in my Data Communications class today
It's got me interested
@mannie.exe .0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 BTC for your thoughts Mannie
Hm. Honestly, my economy core is broken, and I can't consider much. Let me Google things.
idk, it still seems to be possible.
You definitely need to keep things efficient.
Some seed funds could go a bit ways too. Could always invest in some miners as well.
They run up in thousands though. I checked one out for $1.4k.
I'm just thinking for shits n giggles
not tryna get serious
probably just gonna buy some ETH and see where it goes
Yeah, investing directly in bitcoins could be more lucrative, depending on market fluctuations.
Considering that it's been climbing for the past like, six months, it's either gonna crash real soon or keep going for a lil while
Shit, it grew ~2000 USD in the past month
There's nothing shits n' giggly about setting your computer up to mine cryptocurrency. Especially when the fans really rev up, your electric bill skyrockets, your GPU loses its life, and your firstborn explodes while somersaulting over your really hot computer.
And yeah. See what you can do, I s'pose.
Yeah that's why i'm just gonna invest
I didn't build this thing just to kill it lol
In my life, I don't think I've ever had enough money to actually consider investing, so that part of me is just straight up broken and I'm pretty useless in economy.
I'm not talking a lot of monies here. Maybe $50 tops to start. It's more of an experiment tbh
Btw @mannie.exe how's the new job thing coming along?
I got the formal application and pre-offer letter today.
This is the longest hiriing process I've been a part of.
Yeah this is taking pretty long, maybe it's because you're going to be a consultant or something idk
Mhm. Two reasons for that, apparently. TCS internally has two HR departments. One for salary that's $90k and above, and one for the rest. Previously I was sent with the former, as I was going after a lead role, but now I'm stepping into a $80k, non-lead role.
The process apparently had to be restarted 'cuz of that.
And _apparently_, half of TCS thought I already these documents I got today, while I was busy talking to the other half about how I definitely did not. This had been going on for a weeks and a half or so lol.
that'll do it

Unpopular opinion: I actually like the elf designs in Divinity 2. I don't _love_ them, but they do it. @Demi Tarot @timlives @a ghost with purpose
They appear almost feral, in some twisted way.
i like them too
but they arent pretty
I think they're a fresh take, compared to every other rendition of haughty yet super pretty elves.
I think k they're finally interesting
I like super pretty though ( ;^;)
these are unsettling to look at, and seeing one without a shirt makes me physically gag because those weird skin folds they got
like I could almost deal with the long arms, maybe get used to the neck, but those are a deal breaker
if I want to make a spooky elf, I keep the pretty, but make them like, uncanny pretty. Then give'm sharp teeth and black eyes. alien moral codes like fairies, since they descend from them y'know
Which is why I like em. They're not cookie cutter
I'll cut you ( 'A')9
I mean, I also like the more classic elves too. I just appreciate what Larian has done.
Like I said, they're fresh.

Okay. Where is this from? Because this is pretty genius.
I checked out the deal with Destiny 2's playtime XP scaling. I'm sad now.
UGH.
Rant time.

So, the talk about positive reinforcement vs mistake punishment in video games is long-standing. XCOM 2 's mission turn limits come to find, and one might argue that Dark Souls strikes a balance by both punishing mistakes but also naturally rewarding success through many sensations and consequences of accomplishment. In this case, I notice two things: Bungie both failing to do their MMORPG history homework, and mistaking an enforcement of backwater in-game policies as a mechanic that players would simply "mash their face long enough at and end up having _fun_".

Destiny 2 has a glorified lootbox system involving "Engrams" and, uh, "Dust"? They're prefixed "Bright" -- that's how you know they're the real deal. Upon reaching max-level, player's continue to gain XP, but gain Bright Engrams instead of level ups. The joy of it gets sucked out, unfortunately. By upwards of 80%, actually. There is an unfortuante XP scaling system that decreases players' XP based on how much or how long they've played.

The primary principle persisting this problem is the artificial [sic] scarcity of Engrams. At a glance, it _seems_ that this scarcity is an edge to push player's to purchase the in-game currency to, in turn, purchase Engrams and speed up progression. As far to as why its a problem is quite simple: its an ass-backwards way to accomplish an anti-fun thing that seems to have very little consequence reliant on a player's skill -- unless you consider your dedication to play Destiny 2 enough to warrant an XP punishment.
Rested XP (think WoW) is a pretty common concept. You log out in a safe zone, you gain an XP boost when you log back on after a period of time. Prior to that, however, Blizzard tried something else. Something a little more, _ass-backwards_. In short, players would get their XP scaled down by a ridiculous amount after playing for extended periods of time. At that time, the apparent reasoning  behind this was to discourage players from spending too much time on a computer and, _ahem_, ignore their responsibilities. This is a pretty solid parallel, and a prime example of punishing a certain behavior. Blizzard realized that while this system seemed to accomplish the task at hand, players left in a bedgrudging manner and with a bitter taste. To remedy that, Blizzard switched to the system WoW uses now. Players are rewarded for not playing for too long, and remain "neutrally" unpunished for not complying with a glorified time limit.

As promised, the problem I notice in this case is two-fold: first, Bungie "failed" to do their MMORPG homework. Whether Bungie actively chose to ignore such a design decision for other purposes in hard to discern, so they may not have failed at all, but clearly something failed. Lastly, Bungie uses an archaic method for a "modern" problem and says "but if you have money..."

I try to believe that they're just having hard time dealing with an MMORPG scene, or that they're all just really aloof or something.
paraphrasing the phone man, they juse fixed a major fuck up way down the line so my net should be "50% better"
That's hopeful news
@mannie.exe That is why I won't buy Destiny. Bungie made an MMO without considering what the fuck an MMO actually is
It's like they went: "Massive? Well it's takes up a lot of hard drive space. Multiplayer? There are other people involved. Sometimes. Occasionally. If you want. Online? There's internets.
Aight, we have an MMO."

Invest in bitcoin
That'll fix it
#bitcoin
#investor
It hit 18k briefly yesterday. Currently correcting back to 15.4
i saw a reddit post about some big bitcoin site getting hacked
Yeah there was something that happened. ~60M lost
but like
wouldnt it be mildly easy to track a ton of bitcoin being flipped?
so they have to cash in slow
Since bitcoin is back to 15k all the other coin are going back up. Litecoin jumped 30 bucks today I'm super happy
Ethereum is back up to 460

Stephan, Andrew and I hung out on top of each other while I tried to cop some wood and screw with it.
oh right
In the end, nothing worked.
And we all left.
There was a dog though.
Dog was scared of me.
And by "scared", I mean, it didn't really me pet her or anything.
wow. I can't beleive Ivy is a fucking racist.
Yeah we made quite a few brown jokes about that.
Not brown as in, they're targetting brown people, but rather in the sense that they were shit-tier.
well, to the dog more of a dark gray

electricity tickles the meat so that different slimes come out. sometimes the slime feels good sometimes bad. some people make more bad slime than good slime. that‚Äôs called clinical depression.

Code Souls Abridged:
Got invited to the Sea of Thieves tech alpha @mannie.exe @Demi Tarot @timlives @Meko
Oh sick. Lemme check my old emails, I may have an invite as well.
There's no key, it's tied to Gamertag that signed up for the Insider thing
Ahhh.
and I *just* got the email today
Oh.
I've been "invited" since July 11.
Ah, that's right! They actually had a technical alpha planned for summer of this year.
They ended up cancelling it.
Well, I'm gonna reinstall Windows again.
LTSB is neat and all, but turns out Creators update is pretty neat afterall.
I guess you don't miss some features until you mass-remove everything and then go, "oh shit, that was part of _that_?"
Well this is the first time I've ever used the MS Store for, well, anything
gotta use it for Sea of Thieves
BLAZE IT

check out the Rust Punishment Mask on steam market
I bought one for like $5 when they first came out and sold it for $60 after it came off the rust store
Now what are they?
165 is the highest asking price
What are they actually selling for tho
165
209 is the lowest selling price for what people want to sell it for. 165 is the most people are willing to pay
I see...
Yeah that redonkyulus
So i could have made like 160 bucks if i held it for a few more months
To be fair
You did make 55 in profit
true
That's nothing to spit at
i used to buy all my games doing that
Might as well be mad that you didn't buy bitcoin eight years ago
_spits_
*spits back*
**C-C-C-COMBO BREAKEEER**

hello
jared
my internet lied ot me about beig connected the past two days. I missed you guys so much
holy shit i was wondering where you were
i even redid my VR setup in the time you were gone
I was gonna flee to my grandma's and mooch off her internet, but my parents were like "oh you're awake, we're going out with friends can you watch the dog?" and I died inside
then I watched TV and got shit faced, came to my room to draw anime tiddy and lo and behold everything was working again
Well we're glad to see you back
^^^
I missed you guys so much, I was telling my cats and puppies how lonely I was ( ;A;)
dude
missed you too
whenever the net goes out I feel so isolated ad useless it makes me wanna die so I just spend hours grinding in RPGs long past the point it stops being fun
this time;s RPG was Xenoblade Chronicles X, where I tries to set up sattelite probes so I could advance the plot. I never got to 15% and ragequit at 14.8% because all the other probes were in impossible to get locations because of high level monsters that would murder me on sight
but I did find a skimpy underboob armor in a dumpster so there's that
profit
!!!
it matched with my robo gauntlets so it was really cash money
still mad
i'm on the internet and still feel isolated

I just finishe my 5th drink adn I usually stop at 3
they were heavily mixed as well
I finished off my bottles of peach vodka
niiiice
and by niiice, i mean, oh daaaamn
they were nearly empty, but I digress
not *that* nearly empty
my legs are most certainly numb
and frankly it feels euphroic
even more so that I have friendship again
I've never had a good experience with numb legs
ohh, yaay!
I shall draw anime tiddy from joy rather than sorrow tonight
I wish I had gotten some more vodka now...
motor skills permitting
I mean, I could still go get some...
But I _should_ also get my life together...
Porque no los dos?
But I don't _think_ I will accomplish anything tonight anyways...
What is anxiety anyways? What is this? How did I get here?
Who am I?

bro, bruh, broseph, broseiden
you can feel the anxiety, but know, there is always a sunrise to every dark night

phew
Thanks for that.
I think I'll... dooo... sooomething.
Probably start that Cards Against Humanity clone.
watch anime or someting
Feel productive.
Nooo, I always get way too emtionally invested then just get saaad.
But not when I'm in an okay point in life.
Then it's okay.
look, any day you enjoy yourself, or feel something, is a productive day
for folks like us, expecting some big breakthrough in creativity is too much. and that's okay, not every day has to be stunning
I know, I know. I still have a financial crisis to manage that extends through me into my parents' lives.
mmmmmmmmmm
kay
i'm gonna go get some vodka
brb
not now I already stopped
it's okay
everything was FUCKING closed
Yeah dude
It's 1 am

Next, you're going to say how I wasn't even close about my last prediction!
Now you're realizing how all of this is stupid anyways. It's League of Legends.
that doesn't sound like a proper response at all, it just seems like a meta reference
YOU WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE IN YOUR LAST PREDICTION

Didja' know about this? @Demi Tarot
I heard there was a game, didn't know what kind

Its like if the camera in a DBZ game decided to zoom into an area the size of your typical Street Fighter arena.

Something like that
I bought a new mic
The audio technica atr-2500
audio technica? isn't that a brand twitch was advertising?
Was $50 at the bx usually like 80 so i bit on it

Yeah the 2020 is like the yeti
The 2500 is closer to the snowball
But it was cheap so fk it
Yeah that‚Äôs a great deal on it
Nah im just leaving the store now

Had an assessment, a pair programming session, and an intervew end of October. All went really positive. Went in for the in-person interview today which went pretty well as well!
They're hoping to extend a "cotingent" offer within the next 2 weeks, and the client work (and my time at Callibrity) won't kick-in until mid-January to early Febrauary (which is when I'll get the final offer).
That‚Äôs awesome man!
Looking at $65k per year. 401k with 4% matching, sick benefits.
That's great!
Free dental and vision, and 6-months of the general insurance is paid off per year.
Shit's dope.
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much the same setup I‚Äôve got going on
It‚Äôs great!

Well looks like I‚Äôm going to NYC for a job interview üôÉ
Hot damn
Avanade?
Yessir
Oh btw, did you ever get around to doing the thing I requested?
No I‚Äôd didnt. Sorry man. You still want me to do it with the new gig coming up?
Yes, definitely. I've learned not to trust HR people telling me that my "offer will be extended in 2 weeks" -- no matter how awesome of an interview or assessment that I give.
Please.
Can do!
you gotta give'em foloow ups to, they don't tell you that
kiss ass and show you were listening
Oh I have. Was't the issue with the last one, anyways.
I'm going to contact the latest gig tomorrow (a week and a half since the 2 week period just to check in).
I'm interested in this.
I don't even understand why I was so disappointed with Killing Floor 2. Maybe because it was just... nothing. Nothing new, nothing better, nothing different. No reason to really play it.
This might satiate what I was looking for in KF2. We'll see.
I like KF2
and didn't we only play it like once
but yeah this looks neat
Dude, they're making a new System Shock. @timlives
thats cool
So, the initial edge and angst of nicotine withdrawal has worn off. I went from feeling like Shiva the Destroyer, to Vishnu the Preserver, to Agamemnon the Fuck-Upper. At one point I brain engaged RTS hypermode, like that time I wrote my thesis on Donald Glover's music career (the short one), and then I just _understood_ what space is. Hollow Knight's level design is great, and I wanna play some Minecraft. But not the bitch kind. @a ghost with purpose

Callibrity filled the first two teams with their benched developers... they pushed me into team three that won't begin development until March. @Mujin
...so, wanna hook me up with that Avanade recruiter?
@mannie.exe Honestly that‚Äôs still earlier than things will get started with Avenade. The timeline I‚Äôve been given from them is that Avenade won‚Äôt start up until late March/early April. And I emailed the recruiter and haven‚Äôt gotten a response back in a few days
@mannie.exe that amount of time for a waiting period is pretty average for a company with a bigger dev team. When I was looking at GE, it was going to be a 4 month period of waiting before I would start up
Right. But it still means that I now have a bigger window to prospect for other companies.
The waiting is less of an issue and more of an opportunity.
Well, it's a downright financial mess, but I can't really do much about that other than find a job, so...
Just trying to see the brighter, silver lining.

marriage killed that nibba
we noticed you without a title, and Andrew felt sad and was like "wait he's married." and thus you were given the title
it only made me STRONKER

also also idk exactly what version of 1080 i want
PSU gud. I think I have that one in my build
Mobo is a bit much
Everything looks good. Like @Koala said, mobo is a little overkill
I would save money from that and put it towards a 1080ti
Aye.
Performance boost from 1080 to 1080ti is actually pretty substantial
Very.
Why 32GB ram?
never have i ever even used the full 16 I have in my pc

Yeah that‚Äôs almost exactly what I have too. It‚Äôs so nice üëç
plus they just plug straight into the mobo so that's one less pair of cables needed
I will say watch out with the intel card though. With the kernel leak that just came out you‚Äôre going to see about a 10-15% drop in potential performance. For you I would also recommend a ryzen cause those are meant to compete with intels multitasking chips. They‚Äôre supposedly awesome for streaming
also
make sure that the RAM speed is supported by your CPU
I doubt the RAM speed isn't supported by the i7-7700k, but yeah, I would make sure.
that's something that I goofed on so my Ryzen 5 is only running my 3000 MHz RAM is throttled to 2133
Hmmm.
Wait.
not that it really matters but it annoyed me
DDR4-2133/2400
You may need to underclock that RAM.
7700k should support all modern soeeds
The RAM selected is a DDR4-3000. It might work with that speed, or he'll have to underclock.
which will be done automatically by the mobo
Mhm.
in case of no support, like me
And if not, the BIOS should be pretty easy.

holy shit
guys, realization here
okay so, people are made of meat (-'^')-
so when you eat the meat (v'^')v
you get HP (-'^')-
and when you drink water you get MP ( '^')v
because people are basically ghosts inside of meat -('^'-)
and since people are meat and water, obviously the ghost is water \( '^')/
and your ghost erodes when you apply effort. -( '^')-
Don't sleep on this knowledge you cowards ( 'A')9
but where does the gost end and the meat begin?
where the water ends, fuck's sake pay attention.
so does this mean vegans are ghosts inside of plants
plant meat is still meat, those who argue otherwise are damned fools

HAHAHA OH WOW @Mujin
The horns took me way too long
üëç
welp, just had a dream where I stumbled across some werid horrifying image sets on Tumblr. I forgot most except the last two but like. This first one sounds stupid, because like it was 3 people under water, an one farted and one got caught in the bubbles and at first he looked just kind of annoyed, and I was like "ha this is totes Rob, I'mma send it to you guys" but then he started rotting and chasing after them, until one of the two running accidentally farted on the friend running behind him, so he becomes an underwater fast zombie, while the first one ups and vanishes. Then the comic thing cuts ahead till it's just one little girl and she just commits death by fart. Again the fart bubbles are dumb as hell but the art was really god damn disturbing.
( '^')
the 2nd one caught me off guard because I was expecting more image sets but it was apparently a video...unless it wasn't. Where someone was banging on a door screaming to be let in, but all the sounds got drowned out by a loud droning beep, and a handful of bloody figures just blink in for a few seconds and then they and the guy were just gone
the beep was so loud and sudden it woke me up
Woah.
That's fucking cool.
( 'A')
That last one is fucking freaky though. I love how it follows that trope of flashing something fucked up for a moment and then cutting to a dead (geddit?) scene.
Somehow, I relate.
I mean they kinda popped up around him while he was banging on the door
it wasn't just a flash in front of the screen then cut back
it was all one shot
Oh now that's even freakier.
they flickered in along with the beep and then everyone was gone when it went silent
Woaaah. It's like a synchronized death dance.
of dreams in recent memory, though I had one scarier than this, mainly because it wasn't *just* me looking at stuff on the internet. Rather I was in a room that was laid out similar to my room, (same size, me on a bed tucked in the corner on my laptop) and someone linked me a fucking screamer....that looked like it was filmed in the same room I was in, so I turned around and looked out the door into the dark hallway knowing what was coming...and I saw the zombie girl from the video actually walk past the door for a few agonizing seconds before shambling back into my room and screaming me awake
D:
I've had some fucking cosmic horror level dreams. Not recent, but I remember I "dropped" some sort of chemical or some other sci-fi thing-a-ma-bob which "exploded" the entire world at an atomic level to this weird, geometric polymer.
It was like experiencing a glitch sequence, where a glitched object begins to devour everything around it geometrically. Except this is _fucking fast_, as in, the sky itself began to break into these shifting polygons.
Yeah I don't fucking remember any of my dreams
I remember looking up and witnessing a dozen or so geometric, polygonal "planets" that were huge and were apparently close enough to account for upwards of 15% of the sky.
I was like, "shit, did I do that?"
My dead grandma was there too, which made it even weirder.
Oh shit! I have had so many incepted dreams. I forget a lot of them moments after waking up, but some are just weird. I remember being in this white, sterile-looking labyrinth of office corridors. Bursting through an infinite array of doors trying to both find something very specific, and also horrified at the prospect of what might be behind any of those doors. I remember I close my eyes in the dream and wake up somewhere else -- don't remember where -- only to "fall asleep" there to wake up in a dream version of my room. The lighting was surreal, very cinematic. I get up, move around, attempt to reflect on the "dream" I had, then I wake up _again_.
All in one dream.
This is why you don't rapidly compress all of time and space into a singular point of infinite density in your mind, kids.
side note to dream bullshit,  a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh cards have self contained stories in the art
woah

I could definitely optimize the result with some retopologizing, but I didn't wake up today and think to myself, "HEY YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT _**I**_ WANNA DO? MAKE BUNCH OF FUUUCKING SQUUUUARES!"
I'm not throwing the Mothwing Cloak on him. Just the default Knight.

Yee give me a few minutes. I'm getting my computer set up to mine  some coins when I'm not using it
Nice. What are ya' mining?
I setup mine to mine Ethereum when I'm not around lol.
btc right now
how's ethereum?
It's yet another currency. I think the hashing was pretty fat for NVIDIA GPUs as well -- hence why I picked it over BTC.
hmmmmmm I'm using nicehash and I think that pays in BTC
Ahh, cool. I'm using `ethminer` myself. Comes with a little CLI that I can just cron or run batch files for.

ive been looking for the past few days, but im not sure whats the best
p r e b u i l t ?
_triggered_
yes. prebuilt

because right now, they're cheaper than building your own.
blame crypto currency.
yeah...
you can even ask michael, my 1060 6gb was 250 when i bought it because he was with me when it came in. It's now $600 for the exact same one
Take a look at some of the custom-order sites like Cyberpower PC, Origin PC, etc
That's where I'll look
yea i was looking at cyberpower actually
they have decent prebuilds that you can tweak to your wants
Here's a good site
It's literally a dude in his house doing this shit
_AHHHHHHHHH_
yea anything i build with atleast a 1060 puts it over 1k
yeah the market is stupid inflated rn

I've only watch Galko-chan so I can only recommend that
Hmmm.
Then I'll watch one of the two other two so I can possibly recommend it! Besides, I'll eventually watch all three of them anyways.
I'm currently about Aqua's attempt at whistling rn
Hm... just finished the first episode of Made in Abyss. @Demi Tarot
Gotta admit, the world and music are so much more atmospheric than what I've been used to from these past couple of years.
It's a welcome change of pace, to be frank.
The premise seems alright so far, but it is only the first episode.
also in addition to my Ghost Water theory
y'know how most people describe ghosts yeah? floaty, semi transparent? sounds kinda like STEAM
because when you die you get so pissed of your whole watery soul done evaporates

Okay nerds, today's goal is Lorebuilding for the Kamaigne and Sheep (also naming of the sheep)
We know these two groups of religious hoof n' horn havers had a common ancestor that diverged over religious shenanigans or something. Also they got slightly different legs, Sheep are only sheepy from the calf down (or should I say the lamb down) Where as the Kamaige have  goat leg S-Rank Absolute Territory. Also Sheep are :3 and Kamaigne are :I
and the sheeps got FLUFF
so we know the Kamaigne have some business in Legacia, what with them walking around it for eons. But what are goats and sheep known for? Mountains, what's next to the desert? A shit ton of Mountains. So it is likely that in times of early spiderin' the SheepityGoats Ancestors had homes in these mountains, but for some reason they chose or were forced to leave. Probably because of scary spiders, who knows. I've actually been on the fence of taking the Spider Kingdom and relocating it to a different continent, but that's a big shift that'll take more consideration
Anyway questions now WHY are the Kamaigne nomadic now? since the Sheep are using the crooks now, what kinda staves are the Kamaign packing? Are the Sheep Catholic or Baaaptist?
a nice interview with some blizz devs on BfA
reveals a lot about whats new in the new xpc
>reading one line from a scientific article relating to something I need to do for a grade

Pinned a message.
I drew a new icon, but I think the old one was a bit better....but I lost it
@everyone
Yayyy iced at 8:30am
wat
i woke up to a smirnoff ice outside my bedroom door
A fate worse than death
Oh yeah, hab burd day @Koala if still aware of your surroundings
I'm still alive I'm in class lol
One ice so far
There's five left in the house
Its Smirnoff Ice, you could drink 6 in a row and feel nothing
Except the horrible stomach ache from all the sugar
Weak
Heckin gross
Why is this not sending? I have full signal on fiber
I went to a friend's birthday once, and apparently Smirnoff Ice was the best they could get, and it was goddamn honey lemon flavor or some shit
wtf
Honey...lemon
Good god
Yeah like a fuckin cough drop
Ugh
My roommates just tied one to my ceiling fan
And then when I went to get my knife to cut it down there was another in the drawer
Turn the fan on and tell them to come look, then Wham
That was fuckin hilarious
Nah they tied it onto the fan blade
If it was swing around it'd prob ruin the fan lol
Worth it thouh
Remove TP from bathroom, leave one in its place. Put another where the back up TP is stored
Replace their girlfriend with a bottle golem
If I could fit an ice into the tp roll holder that's be amazing
Put one in the tank of the toilet so it messes up the flusher
Nah they'd never look in the reservoir. They're too fucking lazy to actually try fixing issues
Cram it directly in the toilet then
i leik ur new face jared
Yeah the icon I drew didnt scale well, and I lost this ld one
Walked into the bathroom to take a piss
Ice on the sink
Ima drink it in the shower
You're being played like a damn fiddle
It's honestly pretty funny
I need a name for a race of Roman Catholic Sheep
Wooltherans
Dunno, but you're trying and I appreciate that ( '^')-

Haaaaa

HEH
Just saw that.
Wait

I hope the cat was regularly fed, and whatever follows was done as well.
actual picture of jared's goat
can confirm
is jared
They cute, but the only white goat we got is an adult male
Speaking of goats I need to name two sects of Kamaigne. The ones that left to trade, and the ones who stayed in the desert
Not to be confused with the ones who stayed in the desert to trade
Are the ones in the desert to trade just part of the ones who left to trade
Yes
And they accidentally a whole city which became the capitol of the Legacia province
And despite being a kind philanthropist time has distorted the words and meanings of the first Sultan, so now the current Sultan is an arrogant prick trying to live up to the reputation
The Kamaigne wear masks to deter predators,  but it also creeps people out, so having made a secure city, he saw nothing to worry about and cast off his mask because he was truly safe and happy
Current views recall this as "I need not hide behind a mask for I fear nothing." Damn. What a hardass
Most merchant Kamaigne, tentative title the Desh, still wear masks, but they try to make the look festive and inviting. Not always successful, but it's tradition.
A much smaller sect stayed behind to guard the temples of their ancestors, rare Kamaigne who know the way of combat, The Gruph.

fucking rude
Tried to browse tumblr in public on this damn kindle to cut down the backlog when I get home. Tried to link an image and it gave me a 5 mile long link, and forced me back to the top of the page when I swapped tabs
And just now it decided to randomly autoplay a video. I did not have headphones in and it wouldn't stop when I mashed it or TURNED MY DAMN KINDLE OFF
So...not doing that again

so which historical king or emperor is this one supposed to represent
none, that says Jeanne, but looks nothing like Jean D'Arc in Fate
lol I just thought it was a Fate character
I was gonna say you're paranoia shows you're learning
trying to look this up, it could actually be Fate's Jean, but I've never seen that outfit on her
I'm confus now

I dunno how, but signing out of my iphone, turning it off and back on, then signing in again somehow fixed it
but my wi-fi is shit so I only managed to download Discord
Oi, Evil Mannie-Mannie Statue. Ever hear of "Slay the Spire?"
o pick me
( '^')v have you heard of it
Yeah, I've played it a bunch
do you think a deck building game would work for a multi-person dungeon crawl?
I know roll 20 has the ability to make decks
like, do I think multiple people playing slay the spire together would be f un
is that the q
sorta yeah
if everyone had separate turns probably
if you had to spend a bunch of time figuring out cooperatively what to do could lead to sum argues
right
would you say there are "class" cards or like each class has some passive and a starting deck, and any cards acquired in the dungeon are free to use
in StS there are currently 2 classes, both start with a specific "relics" which act as passives and have totally unique class cards
there is a set of general cards as well that both classes get access to but that selection of cards is a lot smaller
yeah, but since that's a video game it's easy enough for it to sort what class you are to give you those cards
in roll20 mode, you'd probably need to keep those separate and draw from a class specific loot deck or something
either way, unlike Kill the Hill, we got positioning and movement
did u just call _Slay the Spire_... _Kill the Hill_?
thats from like 6 years ago lel

I fell asleep in a dream
dude
the night before last I woke up in my bed within a dream
I remember everything looking a little extra fucked.
I checked my phone and the phone's background was this spooky... scene?
I was all like, "I don't remember changing that..."
Then I woke up again.
And everything was 'kay but not 'kay because I was still myself.
The true nightmare.
when I woke up I was in my room, but laying on my bed weird, like I was perpendicular going off the bed, and my lower body was propped on a bunch of chairs and cushions, because other people were in my room around the computer so we just kinda made the entire floor a chair.

Anyway when I came to, some girl was on me, so my half asleep dream vampire ass self just chomped the fuck out of her, then I was like "Jesus Christ, fuck sorry!"
she seemed into it, but STILL
ooohhh kinky
forget "your party meets in a tavern."
...this... this tastes like a campaign idea.
Also, this is what I devolve into when I feel angsty sometimes, a little all the times.

yee all wanna play soem overwatch? @Demi Tarot @timlives @Koala
that sounds fun
I'll pass
Mom seems really hostile about me having a wired connection even though our wi-fi is just shit regardless
the running theory here is that the LAN cable gets priority bandwidth, so the other devices aren't getting anything and it craps out until we reset it
which can't be right because I've had everything off in my room and it still fucking died
I‚Äôll play in like an hour
AWLROIGHTY AN HOWA IT IS
I'll see you pups _on the field_
Moira is fun
I like Moira
@Koala wanna play nao

Late game Lotte outfit
Man I‚Äôm at a mall and the escalator was gated off because it was out of order
Like son it‚Äôs still a functional staircase
So there's a winter storm smack in the middle of when I would get @timlives for our next session.
idk if I can grab the man.
@a ghost with purpose ^
use him as snow tires
Also, thoughts for the sick new mannielikes.design?
Navigation hover state:
Missing contact stuff but I have something in mind for that.
@Mujin @JadedThrasher @timlives ^
Also @Demi Tarot
my legs fuckin hurt
I also made this version:
@mannie.exe  I think that the expansion of the on hover elements is too large, because it goes from tiny box off in the corner to massavive visual element.
Yeah, it's gonna fuck with so many people -- gonna be so great.
idk about the colors yet. I wanna keep a gradient on the big squares, but I think I'm gonna simplify the highlighter colors (if I even use the highlighter version).
My inspiration for the squares was this:  Scroll down a bit, and hover over the companies.
I reduced the gradient colors' contrast, and switched to natural highlighter colors.
In that case its a bit diffrent there is a visual field in which the boxes appeare, its not just small to large boxes. For example the netflix box is bound by its own small box and the three other small boxes that sorround it.
Oh, you mean the fact that 4 individual squares combine to make the big square? I'm gonna try to replicate that.
I may just use flat colors instead of gradients though, as it'll be easier to implement them across squares.
...though I could rasterize the gradient and cut it into smaller squares and use that instead.
so the Dragon Lights Festival (v'^')v
it was neat, don't think it outweighed walking laps around a mall for 4 hours, then having to drive home with one of my headlights out, so I had to make do with the fog lights

the lanterns were pretty neat and the performers were god damn amazing

had them doing flips and rolls and climbing on each others' shoulders while spinning plates, spinning around ropes with two metal bowls full of water without spilling any. balancing shit while performing feats of flexibility you'd swear they had no spine. going through tubes

and the finale had someone in a really elaborate noble looking outfit with a cape and a big hat and a mask doing a sort of dance routine, and they were able to just swap masks in an instant. Unfurl fan, fold it back BOOM new face
one of the masks was a Mickey Mouse face, then they walked off stage and shook hands with people (I was one) before they returned to the stage and continued
@mannie.exe  what about going earlier?
pre storm
Hm...
I could pick him up tomorrow evening, and that'd be the best option.
works for me but i dunno if he'd be down
too bad he slepo now
its your call -- we'll workaround if you think its too fucked to drive or you cant haul auzz earlier
But yeah, I'm down to bring him up here tomorrow evening.
Storm's supposed to clear on Sunday too, so that should be fine.
He'd have to sleep at your place for a couple nights.
yeah
the bed only lasts 48h with a 7 day recharge tho
my router thingy says it had 9 clients connected on wi-fi, but like, I can't even think of 9 devices
we don't have neighbors close enough to leech it
my phone and desktop are disconnected,
my game consoles are off-off or unplugged entirely
I could never get my TV to connect, but it is also off
Judging eyes
hah
oi Mannie, tech help pls
I think I need to update the firmware for my router and I can't find the file anywhere
it's not on the either Netgear's site or AT&T's because they have their heads up their asses
Hmm. Could you get me your router's model number? It's both on it's web interface and router itself.
B90-755025-15
Netgear 7550
I need a 6.5 or higher
but the netgear site says it doesn't support it because it's a branded model
and AT&T doesn't have it listed or anyway to get to it either
Have you accessed your router settings recently? Do you have a page similar to
yeah that's the thing I needed the actual file to do that
but they don't have it anywhere I can just grab it
mom tried chatting with support and they said we had the latest which is bull
if it become an issue again I'll just call

I am no longer Floridated

but isn't Florida good for your teeth?
I made too many nugs
Any of you guys on?
If so, is this PC worth $449 as a starter PC that I can upgrade for Kim.
We just can't really spend more than that and she needs one like now for school work etc
if you're gonna buy it and try to upgrade it then make sure the power supply will be able to accomodate, is all I can say
It's a slim tower. Does that affect anything
well space will be a thing too
Also is price vs performance worth it for what's currently in it
gotta have room
It's only a dual core but decent RAM and storage I guess
tbh I thought you had finally bought something by now lol
So the integrated graphics are trash in it I guess until I get a slim gpu
She just wants to be able to play league on it and do school work
And yea we would have but she wanted a PS4 more and blew $500 on one
lol nbd
I like I doubt that pc will run many games well but WoW and League runs on anything now and she's got the PS4

"Enjoy Yourself" by Saint Pepsi got kicked off YouTube.
FOR THAT REASON
you need money to work on it? I was gonna pay you for it as a surprise, but if you need it to get the job done I don't mind tossing some at you ( '^')v
Oh no. I didn't mean I wanna get paid for the ad, I just meant that I'm stressing about money so I really wanna finish my portfolio so I have a better chance of getting a yob.
Then I can guilt-free focus on your commercial.
I see
Otherwise I'd feel like I'm sabotaging my own chance of getting paid in the future by not getting this done first. SORRY.
It shouldn't take me too long.
Maybe just today and tonight.
...though I did realize that the framework I'm using to build my site doesn't support a key feature that I need for the design to work, and I may have to redo some portions of it in something new...
Haha. I want a career in this.
Mannie until your skills are at **THIS LEVEL** I don't see any jobs coming your way

This cover ( 'A')

'ludicrous speed'
One day Michael and I gazed into the abyss.
The video compression somehow spread just those few pixels pretty much the entire screen at one point.
in English now

suh
WOAH
sorry i escaped
man
i thought **I** was a nerd
pah
don't disrespect nerds
you are, but there are those who are more nerd
no its great @mannie.exe
but i think ive met some **MEGA** nerds
Who'd you meet that made you turn your head in _intense geek out_?
some friggin nerds
imagine the setting for this campaign is basically this DM going,"Tolkein? More like, SuckmydickIcanDoItbetterKein"
i'm back
i made tacos
what kind
and I dropped one coming up the stairs
did the stairs eat it
I'm super sad and pissed
chicken tacos
1 of how many
made the meat in the crock pot
1 or 3
the clutch survives
33.3 - repeating of course %
of my tacos
i bought my mom a new crock pot for her bday
good investment
shit is ca$h
where tf yall go @mannie.exe  @Mujin
probably hell/bed respectively
wow rude
i leave for 15 min to make tacos
say i'll be back
fuckin
*poof*
Yeah, Mike said that was his last game right after you left.
ill be back
mike u lil bitch
And I left afterwards.
yep
it's that guy
mosquito finding a blood vessel
hot penetration action
little bitch can't just zoom in and bit, nah he's gotta jam it in all willy nilly and wiggle around like some kinda fucking amateur
scrub ass mosquitos
more like Mesquite-o's cause I just smoked their asses
listen to it at 1.25 speed
im 20 minutes in xD
@timlives You gotta fuckin watch the first four parts and this
fucking christ
that's, well, that's just fucking evil
like the commenter said, they're just mean spirited
for total assholery
there's not even any reasonable way to detect them
it's not even fun
yeah, I don't see the appeal of insta-death gotcha traps like that
sado-masochism
the only thing more stressful than character death is having a chump death
That said, totally know where to look if I'm ever building my own evil lair
Of nefariousness
That book is awesome...
I wonder if it's in the big RPG book resource...
Windchime at the beginning of the campaign
Windchime post Dragon Egg Deal
so y'know how a lot of sorcs in D&D are powered by getting possessed by some kinda spirit during birth?
that's how these work, except these spirits are horse spirits from our dimension.
They are Horseresses
( '^')- door's that way
what Lotte did to that last Rockman
role reversal

Begone **THOT**
@timlives
i need ur crunchyrorr
new my hero academia
i must weeb
i'll love u
ew gay
i'll pretend to maybe love u platonically
when you finish a drawing but it's subpar
man i finished fire emblem awakening
that was pretty good
important
How dare you?
Meeeh~
how is it that if I leave a soda on my computer desk where there are no food scraps of any sort for more than 5 minutes it gets covered in ants, but leaving a soda adjacent to my laptop which for some reason seems to spawn 1d4 ants every hour or so is untouched
that ant sitch is p weird
Okay no fuck the ant question what I wanna know is
 why was I never informed of alternate universe yandere Hinata?
oh yeah
they grew up
what is that
you guys don't know about post-whatever-the-fuck happens in Shippuden movies?
it's the whole Boruto thing
I mean
i'm watching Boruto
but I don't recognize this shit
it's from Road to Ninja, which I think was Shippuden not Bort
That looks like a fan art
it's a movie
yeah prior to that they released a "what happened to naruto and boiz"
good ol B O R T
yeah it's a movie
like its literally Alternate Universe Yandere Hinata
mike
i did a hackintosh
and Sasook gets turned into an alternate tumblr fantasy boy?
hold me
@Mujin
ü§≤
i can now only play fortnite
overwatch is off the table
instead of a angsty mope man he hits on everyone
and Sakura is the orphan whose father was Hokage
.... did you reformat your whole pc to run MacOS???
i ain't bitch
Bruh.....
miss me with that dual boot shit
then wtf if naruto? the angsty one?
Not worth
i'm just playing
i'm gonna add windows to one of my TB HDDs
I was about to say.... I was all for it until that
I simply don't know when.
After my next paycheck I‚Äôm going to get a 960evo and dual boot it
damn
I have an M.2 960 EVO. Unfortunately my motherboard doesn't have an NVMe slot, so I got a PCI-E adapter.
However, turns out that Hackintosh's on M.2 SSDs plugged into NVMe slots on motherboards get throttled.
Oh really?
So it might be better still to get an M.2 with an NVMe -> PCI-E adapter.
Yeah. I saw a couple posts about it.
The software might have updated since.
that reminds me, need moar stoarage
So it may be avoidable, so check it out.
moar M2
If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll use the 960 for windows and switch my 850 over to MacOS
so, would anyone be interested in trying archeage's fairly new private server? its a lot less grindy than the trion official servers
Don't have Windows yeeet.
And yeah, that would work. @Mujin
Mannie are you turning into Darren
pls don't
first you don't ever have a working PC
then you pedophile
is slippery slope
then you fight and LOSE to the BIG GUY
I need these.
fish's hell
oiwellrntuacleveroneucheekibreeki
also, kim almost lit the house on fire just a few minutes ago
Nicely done Kim.
how
*noice*
Way to go.
tell her to go back and do it right this time
Also wtf hello @timlives
me too thanks
And @a ghost with purpose
üçÜ
she lit one of those pot holder things on fire because she turned the wrong stove eye on
btw  Overhang seasonal event nao
no thanks
i hear her yelling and look over and just see flames like a foot high on the stove
I've turned the stove on before and it just caught fire
yeah
mine does that too
every day
mfw gas stove
...okay I'm getting Windows. @Koala
nah
like an electric
get steam OS
its liiiiiit
hey @timlives  you should finish awakenings cause, after the boat you go fuck the sky and its sick
like my stove
no joke the last missions were too hard and I kept losing dudes so i just sent in MC, chrom, lucina, and 2nd kid and they 2vs200'd that shit
I don't know when I played Fire embem radiant dawn when you get to the part where you fuck the sky there were too many dragons
legit just used all the + stat items on my main character and she could wreck everything by herself, much strategy
All I gotta  say is "Pick a god and pray." is one of the rawest things you can say to a guy before ramming a spear through his intestines
yeah
Wow.
Metal.
I miss the bad ass crit animations of the GBA games though
no shit tho FE:Awakening follows a dope story about how you can beat fate if you're clever as shit and also the main character
and FE4 tells a story of war, incest, cults and cuckery
Those animations are gorgeous. Especially the horse-riding combat ones.
Everything is so graceful.
@Demi Tarot
I know riiiiiiiight
now they just flash, have a face cut in, say a one-liner ....and do a basic ass attack
like literally what we did in the one shot
until the end when we pulled out the real shit
Damn, yeah. The Scared Stones' ones are just a treat.
hey wow oh geez my **friend** just let me know that there's a corruption of champions 2 now
bet **he** is gonna have fun playing that
***friend***
yeah i've also got a **FRIEND** who told me about that
**He** said it's only in early beta right now
only version 0.2.0
wait a second, you guys don't have friends
no...no... this story isn't adding up at all
have memes gone too far
did you guys know theres a text called Xanathars *lost notes* to everything else that has a ton more classes
nandesuka
is this official?
some of my favorites, Entropy cleric and Discord bard
No, it's not a wizard publication
but its by a lot of the same authors
Ayy, now that's what I call _wild_.
Oh, it's a DM's Guild publication.
What are your thoughts on the quality of the included content? I'm gonna check it out for myself in a moment. @a ghost with purpose
I think its pretty good, the mild decline in quality that I notice is mostly due  to fact that all the "easy" stuff has been written already
man
can u believe some people just lie on the internet
hehehe
Let's hope for CA's sake that he's over compensating on the timeline
yeah or else we'll gettem
o god i made a looking for players post in r20, wish me luck new campaign
reading now, holy shit that Barbarian Path of the Courageous Heart fits so well if I wanted to use Maddie
I really like the Mage Hunter wizard and the School of Reconstruction wizard, as well as the Runegard fighter
and this next one has "What's that smell? The sweet blood, how it sings to me...enough to make a man sick!" the ability
Also the Healer's Crossbow
there's some good shit in there and it feels official
it mentioned Wizards in the copyright
and said it can be used with Xanathars
but holy shit I'm liking these more than the features
The new background are cool too
for some LORE, I can totally see a Sacred Kin Barbarian could've been Seraphine's Ancestor, who beat the shit out of stuff, was granted land and a title, and his dragon magic was passed down
like holy hell it is straight up a melee Sorc
J'adore~
moving to Bard, WHY WASN'T THIS THE OFFICIAL BOOK?
Discord bard is hella good
beat a bitch with your lute or shank'em with your flute THEN EXPLOSIVELY TELEPORT KNOCKING YOUR FOES ON THEIR ASSES AND LET OUT A SICK GUITAR SOLO THAT BUFS YOUR PARTY AND
DEBUFFS YOUR FOES
@timlives  you fucking ruined a duel of fates for me you cock
what's the party comp looking like?
nab'
man
there's some friggen nerds
and then theres
looking like bard warlock fighter cleric
oh there's a forf?
wait who is the fourth
Ryan Wox Bin
gesundheit
( '^') what's this guy's red hand?
so there's some nerds
and then there's these folks
am I completing your previous statement correctly
so two mixed casters, a melee and a ~~healsloot~~ full caster
that leaves my options pretty open then
I swear to god this guy is trying to fuck his character in voice chat and she's not even created yet
god how depraved can you be. Lusting for your own characters
BELT OF HIDDEN KNIVES
though you can't throw them :c
but they're +2
wait it doesn't cease to exist till your turn ends
YOU CAN THROW'EM
so is this ninjaguy
12 year old
or the forf
the 12
Christ
how close does the description sound to a League Champ
ninja guy is on push to talk at least so i dunno if he's fapping or not
Oh boy I look forward to seeing Andrews posts on /r/DnD
this ryan guy who just joined sounds like a normal functional human being
and he does not sound happy about his company
"How do I deal with degenerates for players"
What about New Girl
Man, I'm too cynical to deal with randos
new girl went to bed at midnight, said she'd join tomorrow
its okay if it sucks
its a **learning experience**
learning experience is code for Trauma, or a good story for parties
oh, I thought of a better version of that Sword of 1000 Cuts I was using in Michael's one-shot.
instead of just using cloud of daggers on a crit, when you hit something the blade bursts into shrapnel that fly around the target until you recall them, or lose concentration. Of note, since the blade breaks when doing this you can't attack and leave the cloud up at the same time
OH GOD, either I missed it or Michael left out an important part of the Healer's Crossbow. It still does damage when it hits *then* heals
Lmao
*chunk*
OW FUCK - Ohh I feel much better now
Guys this is possibly the best.
@everyone ^
yeah so this ryan guy seems like a normal fella
+1
There's also this v
also the party is all *half-elves*
niiice
I thought Katie Perry was gonna be a Dorf
yeah
bard warlock cleric are helves
I should make a high elf.
"Hello, our party consists of a Two and a half Elves, plus a dwarf"
lool
did we decide if you could play next wednesday?
I'll be home by like 12, and wake up at 9 AM for class the next day, so it should be fine
I never go to sleep till like 2 anyway
the sesh time is 7pm-11pm
that should be fine, depending on how long mom puts off doing this or that
coo
I'm usually fine past 8, but there is a chance dinner won't be ready till past 7, or I'll have to take water to goats
minor annoyances at best
so want me to reserve the 5th spot for your character?
if you would
ofc üòÑ
any idea what you wanna play?
not quite yet, but this supplement has some good ideas even if it isn't "official"
okay just lemme know
the spread is pretty good so far so you have room
a Rogue couldn't go amiss, since I'll actually have a front line to assist....but I've also never tried an archer....but the only archer concept I have is Fairweather and that's MORE LADY ELVES
Cross-dresser boy (Carlisle/ "Carly") would've been a fighter or a bard, so I'll pass on him
archer rogue
who is whomst, Ryan is Ryan obviously, but which is Ninjaguy and which is LeagueBot420
oh wait one has a Zoe icon I think I figured it out
yep
red is 420
I sent you the roll20 link too if you want access to your sheet
What the fuck did I find Michael?  @timlives
@a ghost with purpose I'm imaging this is your campaign, but with more cancer
nah
if its too cancer i will radiate everything
"Does my rogue have a pension"
my sides
so guys
yes chuck
best pc that i can upgrade over time that is currently under 300 dollars
yea
before you say anything
i know
should bought one when i had money
I like how the amount of money available for a PC just keeps decreasing lmao
but kim likes to buy other things and now that we're broke her pc fucking explodes
so she cant even do her school work much less play games
Here ya go
seriously though
like we need a pc for here but we're on a deadass tight budget
ill upgrade it over time, but i just need something to start with, and im not entirely sure if a business level pc is a good starter
due to heating issues, case space, etc
probably go for a shitty laptop with that budget
just for schoolwork
also peep this shiet I made
Yeah just skip the upgradability for now -- idk how Chromebooks are these days, but get something affordable and efficient in that vein. Desktop, laptop, w/e.
The simplicity is actually kinda' soothing. Communicates what's important pretty quickly and feels that extra bit gamified.
@a ghost with purpose ^
its what I want in a "world" map
I love it.
helps visualize terrain, adds noticable landmark and leaves lots of room for adventure
plus even landscapes have stories to tell
Those principles are pretty lost unless you go out of your way to mark and separate territory on "typical" maps.
But here, the map itself is designed with those concepts in mind.
plus its done with a piece of FREEware
woooooooooW
y _AE_     bayb _ee**E**e_ e
i have a problem
I might be realizing I have a strange love of geography/topography
close
I think you have a love for world building.
nah i knew that already
i mean the actually map making bit is pretty damn fun
Right! To be fair, I imagine cartographers as a sort of storytellers.
man i wanna play pool @a ghost with purpose
I'm gonna use this hex tool to map out the larger cities in our campaign to some extent :3
at least calen bar if we ever make it there
Maybe if we make it out of this world, _hehe_.
not in kansas anymore
Indeeeed.
man
i love the little world building chub I get from D&D
Tmi but same
We should collab with Wonderlust stuff like in the future
sure
also: dont let me forget loot from the rock'ems in Albion
Right. Will note it down. I remember you mentioned that the rock shaman dropped a staff.
That it was one of the things that didn't immediately turn to ash and dust.
guess which one of those is actually a girl
Run them hoes?
The pizza?
nope, both dudes
Want more context for the pizza trap
That is the pro league of legends player on C9, Sneaky
he does pretty good crossplays
this was his last one
heh steven is getting turned on by sneaky
Well he does a good job of looking like a female, I'll give him that
wow he's fucking beautiful
wtf
that's so dangerous
this is important
Mom called about the wi-fi
and what do you know, there was a firmware update those lying sacks of shit told us didn't exist ( 'A')9
lolnice
yeah sneaky is a hot girl
no wonder his name is Sneaky
it's not gay if you deny it hard enough
but traps are gay
nah mate
wrong again, white boi @Koala
no u
update: the 12 year old league player is a furry
k
how did you find this out
Corgitaurs
nani
they're pretty great tho
wait what
so
ive been searching all day
what about this
Hey @a ghost with purpose aren't those the ones we used in the computer science lab in high school?
yep
thought so
@Deleted User  that should be fine for school work and stuff
^
good ol regular office/school computer
@timlives
that makes me giggle
keep in mind it only has a vga port, so you have to have a moniter that has one
@a ghost with purpose  shhhhhhh
ah ok
she'd be able to play league on it right?
maybe
prolly
integrated graphics would probably handle Low settings
asking the real questions
tho so would that Cuisinart I linked earlier
she could play league on her laptop with integrated
to put it in perspective, the i5-2400 is a 5 year old processor at this point
wait the text doesn't mention it has a display port, but the picture has one.
it has Intel HD 2000 graphics
wait the text says it has windows 10 but the sticker in the picture says 7
its refurbished
why take the stickers off
but for 300 dollars you could get worse
this will be a good enough stop gap PC so Kim can do work and school
@mannie.exe do u have a Window yet
it is upgradable though right?
mayyyybe? really depends on the power supply
in a sense, it is
i could replace the PSU tho right?
yes
lolno
Wait, I forgot to test out a new method.
I'm gonna do that in a bit.
I'm leaning No on PSU upgrade.
I got distracted watching _Big Trouble in Little China_.
why couldnt i upgrade psu?
I thought I would catch up on the 80's and Kurt Russell -- in no particular order.
no you could upgrade it
but not much
i recommend you look at it more of a stepping stone than a base pc that you'll upgrade
I was responding to @Koala, not you @Deleted User .

Yes.

Nu best girl
Speak of nu best girls, the new season of My Hero Academia has begun floating around...
How exciting.
I've been meaning to catch up in the manga, but the site I was going to took it down, and I dunno where else to look for it since Batoto died and got replaced by a seedier copy or something? ( '^')o
there's one new episode out
it's more or less a recap episode disguised as some slight filler before the new arc
done well, tho
Damn, I'm about to roll the bitchiest of all blunts. I have very little green and my old, cheap pipe that I got for free with a bong broke.

So you guys know that Jesse Eisenberg played the Zucc in _The Social Network_, but did you know Jesse Eisenberg's sister played Hellen Keller in the _really earlies_?
WOAH
Next Video: _Bobby Lee on the Singularity_
wow things escalated huh
this gif is incredibly topical in regards to last weeks session
honestly
the food in FFXV looks better than food in real life
cool
I remember there being a bit of press on just the food in the game lol
im playing on minimum settings and everything is still super pretty
I was running the demo on just about max settings and it looked wonderful
all these lovely new games
just gonna fish forever
lol
think it's worth it so far?
cuz I've been on the fence
it seems worth the sale price i went for
was like $33 i think
yeah
prolly next time its on sale I'll pick it up
don't really have the time rn
I'll say I'm more excited to play thru this game than anything else I've played in the last ~4 months
alright it just got 180% cooler
in about 60 seconds of cutscene
Was it this
no thats the initial fanservice
I just got to the Pacific Rim cut scene
no i meant the mariachi prince
wat
did you even look at the gif
o lol
i thought it was just an img
i fixed it
Oof. I know somebody who'd look _really_ good in a Cindy Aurum cosplay.
She has the hair for it absolutely nailed.
kno any good Cid cosplayers while we're on the topic
*for a friend*
check Sneaky
ü§î
No, but if I ever find **GOD** I'll let you know.
idk i'd bet Jessica Nigri has one
Cosplay of who, _Cid_?
That'd be odd, but I can see it.
Cid is female in 15
see gif above
no
???
That's Cindy Aurum.
Cid's daughter.
Cid's still Cid.
Cid is Pawpaw, he adopted Cindy
oh, muh bad
still
basically female Cid
fucking üçÜ  üçÜ  üçÜ  üöì  ü•í  üåÆ
who is the cucumber
Oh yeah. Jessica Nigri's most definitely pulled this off already.
its DLC
Pickle Rick.
cid looks like a grizzly WW2 vet in 15
he could use a robot arm though
Right? He looks like he'll start chewing tobacco and talking about the war any minute now.
Whoops. I slipped.
its a pretty simple cosplay to pull off but yeah, done mega well
So I found this artist:  @a ghost with purpose
There are few songs on his Vevo that I like including that.
My favorite out of the three
maybe he died
wow that'd be sad
it's like,
carl: "hey guys let's all move there for no reason!"
jim: "okay!"
douglas mcaddams: "hey why's hilbert still over there?"
he just farted
psshhh

I got more than 30+ dms on r20 in response to my lfg

also @Koala  apparently for honor got the rainbow 6 treatment a bit ago and its way better now
but i feel super bittersweet about it, iunno
god damn it
I think I found one of the best insults
@a ghost with purpose we could always take a look
yeh could do
and WOW my friday session DM said he was delaying our D&D session cause his comic book he was reading was getting really good
what a **NERD**
I know Strippin plays a lol of it
wait what
that is
that is dedication right there
what a prick
if he were in this channel right now I'd beat his ass
Yo, someone get in here so I can test my new mic
<> @a ghost with purpose
LOL
wondering how long it takes for lewd requests to roll in from this campaign ü§î
eh?
Andrew's newest campaign or one you're doing?
the former
I ain't doin shit
My bet is on the furry 12 y.o.
bet he'll try some lewd shit within 45 minutes
they seem to be fine in character so far in the supplementary texts, but OoC not sure how much they thorst
He's 17. His existence is thirst.
we were discussing powers, and there was inspiration. THERE WILL BE BAIT
iunno
the 17 year old rejected several sexualizations of women so far
seemed to react in some possible disgust to lewd Burgundy art, disliked Lewd scenes from critical role
did he? I thought he like the burg
it was like a "OH MY" blush response i think
to thong gawker burgandy
Lmao
Ok so maybe the 17 year old is subverting my expectations with his own inexperience
So clearly, the seeker of lewd in the campaign is obviously ANDREW THE DM
AND YOU WOULDVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT TOO
üçÜ
fucked up if true
when does Lotte learn how to do this?
when she lifts
she's lifted Windchime's ass from the gates of the afterlife more times than I can count
I can't count very high
that animation is pretty sick
he does good animation work that looks legit
I like the one where he just has Hector crit by decking someone in the face
"HE'S LOOSE"
lol
I had a dumb idea when I was driving home from school the other day, where I was like "If our D&D characters had personal theme music for a game soundtrack or something, what would the titles be"
"Cancer"
Lotte had the most metal sounding one "Daughter of Life and Death"
Stephan is ban
Steven is gey
I think the one I came up for Sera was "Legacy of Dragons"
Jam had "Poisonberry Jam"
Liam: "One Eyed Wonder"
or
"Puff the Scottish Dragon"
Liam: Gay boy likes dick vol 8
Astrid's would probaliy be somthing like "Endless Shadow" or "Strike from the Shadows"
@a ghost with purpose
Imgur comments are cancer
yeah
Sivir stole that guy's pizza
Elise's is "Almost Relevant"
"Pocket Healer"
fuggin
so andru should I get Final Fantastiddy
I'm bored af
thats a hard maybe
the overarching plot seems interesting but the early chapter objectives are pretty uninspired imo, kinda got bored
yeah but
food
its fun if you wanna crack open some droids with your boys
that's how it always is these days
i find magitek robot soldiers to be super boring enemies as well
like FF 12, it kidna started off in a wat zone, then the character you are gets shit slapped and you get sent over to Vaan, who is irrelevant and stole the main character position with his dumb painted on abs, and you just kinda bumble fuck around until Cool Guy and Hot Bun decide to take you t where the magic happens
i need enenies of flesh and blood so that i can feel their terror as i slaughter them
aren't there like hunting missions and stuff
I recall seeing some bigass monsters n sheit
I realize I have some games in my library that are yet unplayed
I'm going to try out Alpha Protocol
like Tidus was at least marginally related in FFX, but I have no idea why in FF12 they make some dude with no real active motivation in the plot be the MC
also Ashe is *useless*
but she was plot relevant
like many female FF characters
you wanna talk useless female FF characters
fucking the trash fire that was FF4: the After Years introduced a character that was Gilbert's secretary who pretty much only existed to make Gilbert look good, which considering how dumb everything else was, that spoony bard was competent all on his own, so they didn't need to redo the god damn antlion plot *again* to prove a point
man, speaking of reusing plot points, fuckin, there's a dungeon in the first game where you drop down and have to fight a demon wall, across the entirety of After Years you go to that same dungeon and fight that same boss a least 3 times
Grumpy boy finna stab the one whomst interrupted his beauty sleep

an anime about bartending

getting lessons from my friday dm about making money selling erotic novels
speaking of
niiiiiiceee
i like the captured horror
a man saw her underwear out of wedlock!
ooof, now Ninjaguy is flexing that spectrum
I've watched Bartender. @Koala
It's like a fantasy innkeep who's good with words, but it's an IRL bar and a bartender.
Hence, Bartender.
Don't expect sick-ass, anime bartending tricks, but do expect a bartender remembering an old customer he only served once's order and other emotional shenanigans.
It's very 2000's so kinda' dated.
It reeks of 2006
spirit animal
Infinite shitting on Sharknado near the end, but still useful.
alright important question do i want to start writing a *fantasy* novella or a *smut* novella
stfu andrew
banned
aylmao
do both you coward
fantasmut
fantasy smut
done
write CoC you lil bitch
new flav of fanta omg hell yeah
I don't want to imagine what that'd taste like
like disappointment
a shit covered cock
especially because "smut" before meaning porn was another word for horse shit
so yeah nah doakz is probably right
its interesting, turns out you can independently publish e-books to Amazon pretty damn easily
yeah, have you not see Chuck Tingle's works?
is that the gay dinosaur guy
I believe so, I think he also wrote a book about being pounded in the ass by his book about being pounded in the ass by his book
Lol
yeah
alright should I start with *short fiction* a *novelette*  or a *novella*
start smol
wtf are you doing again
writing *Fantasmut* and publishing it on amazon
wait why
for bucks duh
start small
Did your DM put you up to this
craigslist
no, he answered some Qs tho
australian craigslist, to be specific
speaking of that particular campaign, I need details about these plant monster encounters ( 'A')9
conversation was like, "Woot I'm getting my royalties from my published works tomorrow!" and then "Woah, is that hard to do? Do you make much." and the reply of "No."
lmao
make it furry fantasmut, that's how you turn a "No." into a "I don't want to talk about it."
nah i can't write about what doesn't interest me
*scaly* tho
okay, turn into an Uncomfortable shuffling sound
in their tongue he is *Dohvapeen* "DRAGON PORN"

man, the idea of publishing a mediocre short story to amazon is getting me pretty excited. Like even if only one dude ever buys it and he thinks its shit and returns it, still worth
that's the kind of spirit everyone needs
im at 3600 words, 3/6 chapters
1200 words per chapter ( '^')/
good amount I think
its okay for a short story probably, next chapter is the beefy one

Shit, that was actually a spoiler for me.

Hey @Koala, do  you like ambient instrumentals?
yeah kinda
good background music
This has more of a movement, so maybe not the best background music, but still pretty nice.
woah it feels so subtly off
_wooden canons_
infernosaur and soggymander are neat though
they shoot maple syrup ofcc

Honestly, I don't know why this is in my *Albion* notes but I'm scared for you guys:

the tiddy monster is a corpse

but yeah, picture of the big bad
I Google'd _fort twinty_ and then I realized my folly. I was also baked.
ya dinkus
ya know what makes me sad
Mannie has never messaged me on facebook asking me to show bob and vagene
he forsook his heritage
i laughed for so long at work today thinking about that
I feel like NinjaGuy is way overthinking this and Andrew is gonna pull a fast one on us to completely change the playing field
I know you can't reveal your tricks, but what do you make of all this?
wow if that's what made you sad, just wait for the day you're disappointed and in tears @Deleted User
jared you and I both know no plan survives contact with the enemy
and all the stuff about char's dad is speculation but could be true
right, this is why I've been taking all this with a grain of salt.
**salt**
we can plan all we want, but that's making a lot of assumptions that can be fucked by a single roll anywhere in the session
_assumptions_
i think they're okay debating things
all I know is I have a headache
and I'm just tossing in possibilities to be a dick
_**dickache**_
Mannie go lay down
this is beautiful
I was thinking about not revealing that it was a hag eye
but I wanted to see how this party handles between sesh debates
it's a mess
not the worst mess
but like its been two days
and we have hardly any info for making any basis of anything really
side note, I seen some of NinjaGuy/Yoh's art
technically impressive, visually disgusting ( '^')v
is it furry
no
ok thank gawd
but lots of gaping overly detailed orifices so it is actually much *much* worse
ew
so he draws porn
but not regular porn
weird shit
man this group just gets better and better
I'm getting messages why are they not sending
anyway yeah his lineart and coloring is pretty nice, just everything I'm seeing is not remotely erotic in the slightest
wait I wanna see
i mean
i want to see
*cough* my friend
but
wants to see
i also really don't
his tumblr is the same as his discord name
wow those are super gapey
like I could crawl into those
oh goddammit
yeah like the detail quality is ok
but the design / artistic liberty is pretty gross
"liberty"
the proportions are all grotesque
yeah I'm thinking that I very much do _not_ want to see
want a sample image?
...yes
well we're on another list now
honestly like
its just gross
yup
it makes me uncomfortable and I have seen **some shit**
yup
well not the first one as much as the second one
did you see the rest of the second image
but my sensibilites are definitely offended
hold on lemme make sure my door is closed
o ok
tell me when to delet
i feel impure
that's
that's just
well
just
no
people pay him for this
oh I believe it
"I beseech thee sir, I simply cannot get it up unless I can see what she had for breakfast this morning"
a few days ago he said he got so bored in a session he started watching porn
ew
and with the newfound knowledge of what hes into and what he looks like
and the fact we use cam
im worried
*mostly kidding*
he's done a....decent...job of not being a *total* creep
yeah he only mentioned rape a few times
he's just _mostly_ creepy
fuckin wonderful
and in his defense it was discussing Satyrs which are known for boundary issues, but...in game?
there's being bored and watching porn
and then there's _telling people about it_
yeh I have mostly no major issues with him
have known and been friends with more creepy people
but like
yall are mostly strangers
yeh
there's creepiness amongst friends
and then there's creepiness amongst not-friends
still better than Darren
yeah this dude just draws 12 year olds
he doesnt skype fuck them in his grandmas closet
*hurk*
okay, I got a headache from the theorycraft arguments, let's have a cooldown on gross talk so I can keep the pills down long enough to take effect
in the mean time uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh......What's your favorite kinda sword? I'm a rapier man myself, but I still love a good falchion
i like bastard swords
aka hand a half
*and a half
*Evil shall find no shelter, as long as my sacred blade, Yato, the blade of peace, the kingslayer, fear revealed, the blade of the half-prince,  the prophecy revealed, lay in my hands.*
gay
Yato isn't a sword it's a fucking chainsaw
My beautiful *Nihonto* will shine as pure as the moonlight on the waters beyond my parents summerhome
Wait I wanna see gaping orifices. @Demi Tarot
What's the Tumblr/Discord?
no you fucking don't
mannie go back to being high
Hey shut up man.
your funeral
i got u mannie
Yesss. Thanks.
np
ü§î
and suddenly Mannie went on a bad trip
Ooohh. First thing I see is preggo Gwen from Ben 10 with a ganguro alternative, so he's really into white trash.
Ahh, and the rest just belongs on /d/, gotcha.
more or less
whats that
/d/ is "Alternative" hentai
/d/ickgirl
got yer vores
Yeah, I see what you mean by it's just "not erotic" -- he has... a wooden totems built in dedication to his sexual preferences: fetishes.
yer futas
yer diapers
ha you used both meanings of the word to make a joke
yer other weird shit
We talking giantess stuff, so, giant Miku squishing people under her feet (mixes that foot shit yee), hyper engorged body parts (obviously dicks and tits).
yer hucows
(that's human cows)
Oh, hyper puffy nipples go nip-in-tit with engorged boobs duh.
like, hyper puffy nips that are used as phalluses
Oh yeah, any number of forced fetishes and general bdm
Anti-vanilla.
oh i see
you got dicks fuckin' nips, nips fuckin vagoos, nips fuckin dicks, vagoos fuckin dicks
man futa just *doesn't* do it for me
It's like chocolate, but if chocolate was literal brown shit.
I had a phase. @a ghost with purpose
or the chocolate was sentient and used to fuck things
but like
like Futa doesn't weird me out, but its like, eeeeh v( '<')v
Like, chix with dix is one thing, but chicks with dicks with a vagina for balls is too advanced for me.
unless they like put the lady parts in the middle of the ballsack then its like "Jesus fuckign christ how or why"
yeah what he said ^
aye that
wow what a weird night
I saw somebody kickdown a door, somebody pulled out a gun near a campus, this drunk girl asked me what I'd be willing to do for $20, then I discussed futa and /d/ with dudes I play D&D with.
D&/d/
god no
oh
oh no
wait
what _would_ you do for $20, mannie?
I mean I'd draw something, though I upped my prices so if you want full color that'll be 10 dollars more
idk what i'd do for 20
but what would you for $20 @mannie.exe
what did you tell her
"I am not gay, but twent dolla, is twenty dolla"
Ooff, well, she was drunk and making out with this other black guy at some point, so I had stopped caring at some point.
BUT. She was extremely hot.
ok
but
A lot is the answer.
ok
;]
;;;]]]]]
XDDD
just don't go ass to mouth
That's already checked off the list.
i mean
unless she's into it
idk
consent is pretty key
Yeah the rest is up to chance.
that's more sticking order rather than your mouth to her ass
nothing wrong with tossing salad
Oh no, we talking mouth to ass.
don't stick pp in butt then in mouth
A rimjob, if you might.
Yeah that's, uh, that's too far for me.
Same with ass -> vagina actually.
we were talking AtM not eatin booty like the groceries
that's less an intentional thing unless you're an asshole, and more you not being considerate
Yeaaah. With the amount of lube required, you can't just "accidentally" an asshole.
the fuck my dude
you don't accidentally the asshole, you just go too ham post intentionally the asshole and put it in another port
meat go off
yeah that's typically how you accidentally the booty
@a ghost with purpose apparently For Honor has changed a lot
i kinda wanna go and check things out
wbu
kinda
im not in a super video game mood but i might
see you tomorrow night fuckers
yeehaww-_barf_

wtf Matt Mercer showed up on a Grump stream
aaaaaaaaa its game night and I was only able to make one token

and this is the fuck upper
stfen's butthole is this üëå big
what, the space between the index finger and the thumb, or the ring itself?
we talking sphincters so I'm bound to believe the latter, butt still
don't...just don't acknowledge it
SO did Chimey get any neat visual upgrades
that are noticeable from the shoulder up?
We're going to do the "solo" session at the table.
Don't worry about the token for this session.
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
...but I might commission the token.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
yep
let the horror of performance anxiety simmer in
but it's okay
i'll beat you if it's shit
the TOKENS are a ***GIFT***
We'll make it a full-body with a scene and pose. Might do the scene myself if you're not down. Probably not.
I'll crop a token out of it.
Monochrome.
PRICE?
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
it's fascinating, the internet
you can learn so much about what someone's into by googling their usename and finding their fanfiction works on *Archive of Our Own*
the price is the tokens are intentionally made so the entire party has cohesion ( 'A')9
but monochrome stuff is 15, probably another 5 for the background idk
I'll do you $20 for a nicely posed Wind Chime up to my Client From Hell level description.
we can talk business after graduation
in the meantime

Oh.
Because this is kinda amusing ngl
how can I NOT beat it off
that'd just be rude
üçÜ
its not as intense as Astrid's, but Lotte ain't intense I guess
Sure makes my glad that I just browse reddit for porn
And that I dont create porn
I mean, if you're good at it you make good money
...and apparently if you're absolutely god awful at it too
Not that theres anything wrong with creating it, I just dont like the idea of someone doing what Andrew is doing
To me, at least
yeah running two D&D campaigns a week is some crazy shit
well
its cause you're ashamed of it :p
for both ninja guy and my friday DM, they own it
revel in it even

character creation cooler
more space, more kerfluffle
instead of 3 phase battles mostly controlled by the pilot its split up between 5 roles, Captain, engineering, gunnery, bridge, comms
and every station has their own roles
I like that, reminds me of Puzzle Pirates

So I was fucking knocked off my feet about 30 seconds ago.
I watched a YouTube video and began watching what I thought was TES VI: Summerset. We talking elves going "hey you know what let's open our nation because we think the political climate or something is changing or think something is changing anyways."
Then it was revealed it was actually an TES Online expansion lmao.
Kinda' interested because that feels pretty _large_ ahuhuhu.
you guys ever notice that bill clinton always looks like he has no idea where the fuck he is or how he got there

like fuckin, you got protons and neutrons, and just because one proton is added it completely changes it into something else
like you got fuckin gold. add one little proton AND IT FUCKING TURNS SILVER AND MELTS, one more proton and BOOM SOLID AGAIN
add poisonous gas to metal and what do you get? SALT
take two flammable gases and put them together? fire killing liquid
and like every time you jump a line it's like a Gas, then BAM metal
is salt metal?
fuck man
and this isn't some video game logic bullshit, this is how reality works
I think about this almost every day of my life
alright; 3 d&d commitments has become 4
what have you done
you said no more because you wanted Tsars without Lumber
my dreams of being a tiny feral girl with telekinesis will remain forever on hold
andru what the fuck are you doin
next thing you know you'll be suckin dick on the streets asking johns if they wanna join your campaign
Fucking Chemistry. Yes. I know what you mean. I think about it literally every waking moment of my life. @Demi Tarot
That and the fact that if we were fast enough, we could pass through solid objects which are actually just moving really fast, like some object from a game world with a fixed update time, to create permanence or something.
I'm playing in a sat afternoon-ish campaign starting in may
1pm-5pm
someone from my friday game decided to host a game over the summer
That's pretty cool, dice boy.

@timlives
lookit this bitch bout to go hard on that burg with a knife and fork, c'mon now
found my new fetish
eating burgers with a knife and fork?
you fucking disgust me
i cannot abide such degeneracy
not me, *her*
anime girls eating burgers?
what, cute akneemay girls eating burgers?
that's fine
i still have issue with the knife and fork
Look, the pristine capture of joy, a glimpse through the gates of heaven handily stolen away by her eager eyes. My manhood sings in pleasant compliance at the sight of it.
alright im sorry
i can delete it if you want
that was
Andrew I'm gonna make your fuckin night

i physically cringed at that sentence

jared its just gonna be me you and three strangers at this rate
man, I had a dream you were running something, but my dream kinda just mashed a bunch of shit together
@Demi Tarot
like, I was doing the book of knowledge thing for the Githzerai, but I was playing as Patty not Lotte, and Patty had a lot of fucking insight to put into the book for a country bumpkin, and the tomekeeper was like "Damn, sister, get me my keys, we're going to the Prime Plane" no idea what that meant because my desktop then froze from over heating or having a panel too tight or too loose
once I finally got that fixed by fiddling with some rubbery straps that looped onto each other to hold the case in place instead of screws like a normal person, I popped back in like "Yeah I had to help my computer put its panties back on, what'd I miss?" and apparently Mannie and Michael *assumedly in game* had gone on a crazy ass trip through various planes to activate some mechs. It wasn't stated out loud, but my brain intuition said that Patty's reward was piloting one of those mechs
thats incredible
Look up Aggretsuko on Netflix. You won't be disappointed.
yeah it's cute
what if I wanna be disappointed.

everytime I see bolton calling Stephan gay
heck
thinking on it, since her OG outfit looks vaguely central american, I imagine her civilization was descended from a colony of spanish speaking humans that got stranded on some hellhole. So her language is some derivative of spanglish that should easily be translatable by any translator collars, or hell, learning english wouldn't be a huge jump especially if someone else who spoke spanish was helping her

@Koala I'm at twin dragon with my aunt, this girl just grabbed a soup bowl and filled it with french fries. Then proceeded to spray the bowl in filthy spicy mayo, and sat down and went to work with a spoon
i dunno how to feel about anything anymore
i mean, fries and spicy mayo are decent combo
but
BUT
not a go-to for Twin Dragon
but thats all she's eating
thats the whole meal
D:
okay
she needs to take a step back

So you're running with a toast in your mouth as you bump into some guy from your high school, but it's a rom-com so you actually bump into Jerry Seinfeld, and you're actually on the set of a live action rom-com based on every anime trope imaginable.

y'know......what if I combined Briskwillow with Wonderlust races?
All - Wisdom +2, Small, Walk Speed of 25, innate casting 1/day Lv.1 Minor illusion, Lv.3 disguise self, Lv. 5 Mirror Image, Advantage on Int, Wis, and Cha Saving Throws against magic.

need ability for sub-races
Prima - OG traditionalists, spiritual, they got totems
Desh - Merchants
Gruph - actually fight if need be, act as guardians.
also need traits for Religious Sheep peeps. got their size and ABI and stuff, apart from that though idk
Well today is going fine aside from the fact I forgot my wallet
So for the language thing, I read that some languages are dialects ie Aquan and Terran are both Primordial, so I can have Grumblish as an elvish dialect
And it sorta counts as elvish, but is more personalized
yeh, works
Update on the wallet story: mom brought it to me, proceeds to lock keys in her truck
What a rollercoaster
Side story we got lunch at McDonalds and my burg didn‚Äôt get cooked all the way
wat
is that possible
Got it replaced but it was pretty much hot oil with meat in it somewhere
I know understand what Hank meant when he said ‚Äútaste the meat not the heat ‚Äú
lmao
My mom‚Äôs cousin was in the area to help with that mess, waiting to hear what inconvenience hits her

favorite quote so far, "When I was in college, I tried going to a party once."
Dude Hanzo's new Storm Arrow is pretty fun. @Mujin
tall fuggin wolf-men claws, a 1d4+str or 1d6+str unarmed strikes?
the usual seems like 1d4, but lizardmen have a 1d6 bite
also looking into proficiency with natural weapons, the Aarakocra entry in DnDBeyond says they are (and the Lizardman and Tabaxi entries are behind a paywall so I can't check those) but Volo's doesn't mention a proficiency

trying to find other entries on the Aarkocra, it doesn't mention proficiency on those either
though it feels kinda moot anyway since you likely won't make use of claw weapons unless you're like a monk or something, but they already get a damage bump for unarmed strikes
then again you could just follow up with an unarmed strike as a bonus action if you got nothing else to do with it.
you can't do an unarmed strike with a bonus action unless you're a monk
well screw that then
to get to use your bonus action to make a weapon attack you have to have a "light" weapon  or dual wielder feat and any kinda weapon
in your offhand
yeah I've been looking at that, apparently unarmed strikes are not *weapons* but they still count as *melee weapons strikes* meaning you cannot use magic weapon to enchant your hands, but you can still use branding smite
Since I had them pegged as the working class that value getting shit done and put up with a lot of bullshit I gave the Hornless Pushar the powerful build thing so they count as Large when moving, pushing and dragging things
and the Half-Orc's endurance thing where they can stay at 1 HP if they're not outright killed by an attack.
for earlier question ^
thaaaaaaaaank you I went through so many things that were only tangently related
so for the Horned Boys, we've established they have a defensive version of Lucky they can use once per long rest, I feel that's not super strong, so they could probably have another trait. Is a free Sorc cantrip a solid one considering they get a Cha boost?
and since the Pre-Cog is specifically for one thing instead of all, and 1 use instead of 3, would it be better if it could refresh on a short rest?
sooooooo now they're looking like
[STR +2, Claws, Cold Resist, Intimidation Prof] + [CHA+1, Pre-Cog, Sorc Cantrip] OR [CON+1, Large Liftin, Endurance]
the sub races are good now I think, does the base need another ability or is that enough?

would giving ~~Pack Tactics~~ Herd Mentality to some sheepy priests make sense?
if so I'm done with this set at least
so with those done, the Wonder Races that remain (that have some establishment atm) are the Chateau, Dropii, Sichosi and Verma
Races that need developed in general: Dinobois, Plantbois, Oldbois, FishnetBaes
to my programmer guys, you've been dressing wrong
Grumblies = Grumbloire, goddess of the forest.
Fasolatis = Doremi, goddess of dreams and creativity
Kamaigne = Hagakki the Sky Mother, and her children, BankiBanki god of Magic, JiriJiri god of wind, MoguMogu      goddess of earth, and PechaPecha goddess of rain
Sichosi = Kanzi Zisu, the world spider
omg beat saber has high scores

FINAL BOSS
I think @Deleted User might be interested in them socks
oof, I asked for critiques on my races, and now I got a guy trying to tell me the Kamagine's Arcane Insight that I took from the gnomes was a bit overpowered
I will budge that Pack Tactics can be pretty strong on a PC though
also suggested I give fasolatis another trait because they seemed up, so we opted for the wood elves' mask of the wild, since it fit with the other role of fasolatis, Rogues
holy shit
lmao
none of your races are more powerful than half elf so i wouldnt stress too much
I remembered martial artist monkey bandits were a thing

also my dad is out drinking so I'll probably have to drive over and pick him up in a bit
yuck
it should be fine unless it ends up like last time when I had to cart that group's "big guy" equivalent (but worse) home too
no one likes him, but he pops over uninvited anyways and drinks way too much, like the last time I had to go pick up my parents, I had to take him home too because he was too drunk to stand, and they pretty much had to steal his keys so he wouldn't try to drive. He had gotten so drunk he fell and smashed my uncle's oven door, ad tried to play it off like it didn't happen.
and he was still saying he was col to drive and asking for his keys and saying he didn't need help even after I was already in his parking lot, I honestly thought my dad was going to beat the shit out of him. Then when they finally carted him into his house, which was a pain in the ass because he didn't know where his keys were, he forgot we brought him home nd though mom was trying to break into his house.
this is why I respect my limits when I drink, because holy fuck.
he knows what you're gonna say, he's betting on it

my dangass monkey brain started screeching at me about some tabletop project that was sittin' around, that's kinda Sci-Fantasy, as in it's mostly fantasy but there's a lotta beep-boopery
all I know is it's class focused and has aesthetic similar to Hyper Light Drifter, and the classes I came up with have pretty unique mechanics and shit, but most applications seem combat oriented thus far
but like one class uses a bunch of orbiting drones to do shit, another uses a body double, and another one is a weeb that uses sword stances and techniques
I'm sitting on the floor of the Spectrum store in Tri County mall, waiting for the six old people to either get through the queue or die

oh yeah imbordant kestion. Roll Stats or Point Buy
Croox is a monk, tradition undecided but leading Sun Soul, but expressed interest in shadow or fist
or may be Blood Hunter
since it's a one-shot and I'm dropping you off at the dungeon with most of the story anyway it's not a spoiler, so: You guys are fighting The Grimbly, who is a Grumbly that was born with potent magical powers, but the misfortune to be born in elitist grumble territory, so he was mocked and thrown out and is gunning for revenge on everything with an army of mutated forest creatures and brow-beaten minions
Roll
( '^') (.v. ) ( '^')

my phone showed the roll or point buy message at the bottom of the screen so I thought that was the most recent message

wait, shit. Did you have any Grumbly questions?

I was think about a Civ Night, but no Mikkle no buy
you thought about your Grumbledin any?
in what way
looks, personality, name, what magical doodad you'd want
yes
while looking up reference images I found this
close
do u have some grumbly art on hand
this was the scout I played in the one-shot
can I get a ridiculously large weapon that has an extra damage die
like a buster great sword that does a 3d6
or something similar
they're generally solidly built, have fangs or tusks, don't typically wear shoes, and have hair that covers their eyes.
I think I'll allow that with the caveat that it doesn't give you any +'s to hit, like most special weapons would.
something like this
but tuned appropriately
brown bushy anime hair, tusks, n heavily armored kinda like this
that'd work
you can have the moustache too if you want
nice
lemme know the details of whatever the magic doodad is
im okay if you decide to make it stronger and give it a penalty to hit or something
Does Magic Weapon that does 3d6, sound too plain? I was thinking of giving you something that gives you an Orc/gnoll's ability to run up and whack something if you kill a creature
it shall be "GRUMBLOIRE'S KITCHEN KNIFE" Your foe will know true fear when it realizes it is the only one in the kitchen who can get stabbed
give the frying pan a dent on the way out, just in case
only 3d6 weapon die and nothing else is pretty plain but I'm fine with that if its in line with how powerful you want the items to be
is it a magic weapon for terms of damage type?
it cuts through things that resist non-magical weapons

So Kim brought up a good point dudes.
Imagine a VR MOBA.
Like if League had VR.
It would be terrifying to be ganked.
That sounds disorienting.
70% of the players would be unable to last hit or so anything properly because they got GIGA TITS RIGHT THERE when they look down
That would be pretty neat tho
I imagine it being a mix of like an FPSRPG and a MOBA
Theres a few neato shooter for VR that I'd like to play

what kind of game is it
Like monster hunter

btw
you stop paying attention for five seconds and they make 71 games you don't know about
another werewolf inspired prompt. A halfling becomes a werewolf, no one notices the difference because he was already hairy with an absurd appetite
alternatively, he becomes a Pomeranian
Dauntless definitely needed the closed beta label when Michael, Stephan, Mike S., and I tried it out last year. @a ghost with purpose @Meko
Too bad MH: World isn't out on PC yet.
@mannie.exe it had the label
I never said it didn't. I simply meant it was justified because it was pretty shit***.
Ah
Yeah
It was very rough

I've essentially skipped half a generation of video games with the lack of a Switch and PS4. Kinda' exciting knowing that I'll have a ton of distraction and some point in the future, hoihoi.
i literally used my switch for mario kart and zelda, after that it's just been big chillin
waiting for super slambo boys
I would use a Switch for all of the above + Odyssey.

I WANNA SPLATOON

aight, Andrew, going back to that one race idea that has an innate shifting ability into a specific form. considering you have it off the bat at level 1, what would you say would make it fair yet useful
as of now it's a tiny, fiend with a flying speed, that keeps the player's statistics, but their equipment doesn't merge on transformation. Seeing as they can still speak, move their hands, and at least carry a focus, would letting them have access to their spells be weird? Druids in beast shape can't cast spells, but I assume that's in part to the whole....bein' a bar
shapeshift but losing gear is awful
i would never use it
well you don't lose it, it just doesn't schlorp into your skin. It's mostly an issue here that your armor won't fit, though you'd probably not be playing these guys as a martial class anyway, and if you were you'd likely be planning around it. Lycanthropes don't merge with their equipment either and they can get LARGE, so they probably don't bother wearing armor either
though if it's a big concern I can have it meld
Half-shifted Lycans can even pick up a huge ax and beat you with it
like if the purpose of this shapeshift is to give you a tiny flight form I'd never use it if I had to leave my equipment behind every time I did it
fair enough
I would just make it wild shape limited to one weakass form and once per day
oh hey it's Ted Cruz

He has Discord integration for currently playing games disabled though. What does STEAAAM say?
He had to disabled discord integration because of all the VR porn games he's gonna shamefully play
"shamefully"
if it wasn't shamefully he wouldn't have disabled the integration
okay true
steam says he ain't playin nuuuuuuffin
He's gonna play a lot of Beatsaber if you know what i mean

I just discovered this Persona in Persona4, meet Mara.

I seen earlier
were you here the other day when I dropped that Green Man McBasket Ball stab is literally Ace from the Gangreen gang from the Powerpuff Girls?
I thought ball stab was just Murdoc with a new haircut
guess not
nah Murdoc's in jail
ah
I REMEMBER THAT LAD.
And I thought that was Murdoc for a minute as well.
But aged Ace from PPG?
Woah.
Murdoc ain't got a pointy nose
though apparently if you want to play Bass for the Gorillaz you gotta be green

I'm pretty torn whether I should I ask $5 per player per session or $10 or something in between for my paid GMing debut
tree fiddy
No, too low
and then they realize their DM is actually a three story tall creature from the paleolithic era
that's incredibly unhelpful, but thanks for your contribution to the conversation
Gatdamn Loch Ness Monster
start at 10 and be open to negotiation?
or start em cheap to get them hooked
like a dealer
5 per session is probably fair, but I personally prefer buying things in bulk
it feels like a rental paying every session, but that's just me ( '^')o
I'm thinking $10 is what I want to gravitate towards and what my time is worth but since this is my first time doing it 'professionally' I'm not sure my skills/experience make me 'worth' that amount yet
Go with 10
or rather, think about how many hours you'd spend working on prep and then actually hosting a session, and figure out how much you'd like to make per hour
it's hard to tell what nerds will pay for
if you wanna really get into it
we'll spend hundreds on anime figures and pillows, but *fuck* buying video games
the "well if this was a real job I'd need to charge $18.65 per player to make $12 per hour for the session and prep" attitude is the wrong approach for this type of thing
just a thought
mhm
Basically, the scale is closer to $5 means more interest, I will definitely have players that are more likely to be satisfied and keep playing. And closer to $10 means I'll have less interested players, and they'll be harder to keep engaged
I'm tempted to start on the safe side
PRICE PENETRATION STRATEGY
strike into the market low, and once you nestle in, you have room to increase once you have a customer base to vouch for your quality
correct
Jared is better at business than I am
the problem with pps properly in this situation is that paid GMs have infinite competition from those willing to do it for even less, free
so to be successful you have to be low enough to garner interest while also proving that you're 'better' than other services offered
I would hope so with how much money I spent to get a piece of paper that said "better at business than Stephan"
My theory is I can charge less now to get the ball rolling, and charge more later when I've more experience to 'prove' that my skills are worth more money, as well as the confidence boost
it helps I'm not really concerned about how much money i'm making, nor 'getting paid enough to be worth my time'
yeah you don't need to live off this, so maximizing profits ain't a big deal
fair enought
the strategy that turns this into a 'career' or otherwise something I can live off of is if I become renowned or skilled enough to charge exuberantly more (unlikely), or I use this as a stepping stone to get into the RPG podcast/broadcast entertainment scene (more likely)
fuck league
fuck everything about that cuntfuck game
im done
@Demi Tarot  what "bundles" would interest you personally, if this was the type of thing you were willing to spend money on
monthly? or possibly like a "buy once" where you pay for the expected campaign length of like, 60 sessions, up front
like probably pay per month or something v( '^')v
should pay per month be at a discount
slightly, maybe
like instead of the price of four sessions $20, like , $17.50 or something
that seems about right
$17.50 for a month of D&D involvement seems damn reasonable to me
i want to ask, do you guys think if you buy a game, and then they later shut down not only all support for the game, but the servers as well, considering there is no way to play it offline as it is an online only game, should steam refund you?
not if you don't meet the steam refund guidelines anymore
which is to say, you played more than two hours
i only played 5 hours, but now its a 40 dollar game sitting in my steam library that literally cant even be played
what game
ghost in the shell stand alone complex first assault online
thats a long ass name
probably not steams problem
maybe the game devs should refund
its just not fair for the devs to take the money and dip
oh i can get a refund from nexon
but its their fucking currency
not my steam money back
hell yeah
get me some ncoins brother
like id buy shit from them after that
might as well take what you can get, i guess
should I bother offering a pay-for-60 sessions up front at a larger discount, not sure anyone would be interested and its a pretty fat commitment
not like you can predict how long a session will go
you mean a campaign?
yeah
hm
for months where we would have five sessions I need to charge more though
I suppose that shouldn't be a huge deal
I would be more worried about players having doubts about their own commitment for 60 damn sessions. How would you deal with the possibility of potential disinterest and subsequent requests for refund?
60 sessions is a lot of sessions
like
a lot
14 months
give or take
if you do weekly sessions
which I imagine is the general schtick
if the price was like $255 ( for 60 sessions *5 at a 15% discount) then it'd be a refund on whatever sessions are left from the count, so $127.5 refunded on 30 sessions
@mantheman
but I foresee problems with that
@jthered
overdunk yet?\
it's a gig download
but I think the big bulk is probably excessive
monthly should be fine for people that wanna pay a bit more than per sesh
How much remaining and when did you start/ETA? @Demi Tarot
I had to go do something and figured you guys would have started and finished already so I didn't bother

we just cut off this monsters arm
and put its arm in a bag of holding so it couldn't reattach
cause it kept regenerating
That was pretty clever
@Deleted User fucklefield is ready babe
nah it all went to shit cause the monster arm in the bag started regenerating a whole new monster
and ruined the bag and all the stuff
anyone watching e3?
i be
fucking knew DICE would announce Battlefield Royale
the crowd yelled NOooooooo
I even yelled Noooo
...They got inControl to come in for a mobile game
Its Sc2 pros doing a promo for a Command and Conquer game
its pretty clever
yeah
too bad EA's turned C&C into crap
lol
its been crap for awhile
yeah
wasn't just talking about this game lol
EA has been about as boring as I expected
surprised there was so very little about battlefield V
They've always saved a fair bit for the Xbox conf
there's an xbox conference?
part of e3 right?
yeah
during the week sometime
long way away
Well that was boring
next character idea right here
Oh it's Rosa from Black Lagoon
That is a pretty good idea
Okay guys I'm gonna run a campaign centered around Touhou

we getting proper prepared for tonight, had to recalibrate Michael's luck
it was too good so we were worried he'd use it up before the game started
what was he using his luck on
he was good enough at Osu to not be mad
so he started rolling dice and they were all above 10
so we made him roll until he got a bunch of shit ones and had him roll those up and stop
we ended on a 1 and a 9 so we should get average to good on the next few rolls
nice
won't matter though
y'know wot I should do? Some Seraphine tiers + Bonus outfit
do et
the original Tier 2 dress I made for Seraphine was ugly as sin so I'll have to do it alll from scratch

Thanks for the song. I'm digging it.
I still wanna setup **_S   T R   E     A  M        _** software.
wtf there's a Division 2?
oh damn
Another Tomb Raider.
A little excited.
Shit. _Another_ Assassin's Creed game?
The game was shit and weird to begin with, but now I just feel like the one AAA video game franchise I enjoyed is being fucking molested right in front of me.
Unfortunate.
I got d&d in a hot minute sorry mate
I really enjoyed the trailer for AC Odyessy
Peloponnesian war stuff is wicked cool, and its an rpg where I can be a badass spartan lesbian
I'm into it
Shiiit. I really hope it's fun and does well.
I just wanna play Assassin's Creed again.
Also! TESVI! High Rock, presumably? I saw the teaser for it very late last night/early morning.
Curious to see how that plays for sure. @timlives
MEH
The tes:6 stuff was pretty disappointing
"Hey we're making this game we're obviously going to make, in like four years probably sorry"
Oh is that pretty much what was revealed?
Sounds about right. They did the same thing with Skyrim.
Except the wait was hella' longer.
IIRC they first showed Skyrim at E3 2009?
did you guys see the gag skit they did making fun of skyrimt his year
watch it
Yes. We were there
that shit is gold
Mannie wasn't
O ye
And there are more people in chat than you cunt üòõ

steam is fucking stupid
Yep
i had to completely remove ESO from my account and re buy it. Because it wouldnt loet me buy the version that comes with morrowind since i already owned eso. it wanted me to spend $25 to buy premium currency to buy the dlc.
Ewwwwww
That sucks
yea it was only 10 bucks though
So why did you have to remove and rebuy in the first place?
Because it wouldnt let me buy the game again with the morrowind dlc. i only had the base game originally. i wanted morrowind dlc. the base game on steam now comes with the morrowind dlc and its on sale for $10.
it would only let me buy it as a gift though because i already owned it
Ah
Left the game when it was over, reprort

@Deleted User
I... I'm gonna do it, @timlives. It's that time of the year again.
I'm gonna go _outside_.
~~Wait, I meant I'm gonna install _Arch Linux_.~~
Nope.
Don't install Arch Linux
No
Just think
"What would Darren do?"
And then *do exactly the opposite*
Well he would probably install Ubuntu.
v( '^')v
I believe he put Arch or some other distro because he's fucking dumb
And then would complain about all the shit that went wrong
I think I was the first person out of our friend group to say "fuck it" and spend three days installing and customizing an Arch Linux installation.
I don't think I ever truly complained about it either -- mostly because it's easy to see where things go wrong and fix it.
Yes but you aren't Darren
tru
What is an arch Linux?
And yea @Koala  I'll remind you when I get on after work. I'll be on about 4-4:30.
It's one of many various distributions of linux that you can use as an OS
an arch linux is the most pwoerful kind of linux there is
Ah ok
Does that mean you lose the windows OS? Or is it like a digital OS. I hope that's the right word for I lol

@timlives @Demi Tarot
u slep? We are looking tah play some Jackbox party games. @Demi Tarot
I've always been iffy on those since my stream tends to fuck up a lot
uh
idk how but we'll figure it out
maybe have one of us stream it?
do you own it?
or do you mean that you can't watch strams?
yeah, lagging and buffering makes it really hard to play the game
if you play as a player
theres no stream
@Demi Tarot
you play thru broswer
browser*
(v'^')v there is though, that's where all the content is
I've done these before
you're thinking of
playing as audience
playing as player is a bit difference
different*
no I'm not, I've literally done this multiple times
k'
You lag in the browser as well?
We weren't gonna stream the thing-a-ma-jig.
That's sad. I'm sad.
alexa play despacito
fvsp
besides we could just use rabbid or something else low latency
well we're playing thru a discord call if you wanna join us jurd
hey andrew, did your burn out only apply to DMing, or playing too?

MURICA FUCK YEA!!!!
I think I know what happened to those hobgobs
butt stuff?\
just a theory, and not sure how true it holds since it also affect the Warg but
I think the time displacement is per group, (we all went in at once and were affected at once you see) the hobgoblins who had been there who knows when, were being affected by time much more slowly than us to the point they seemed frozen, poking one probably somehow brought it to our perception of time. They weren't frozen, we were just moving really fast ( 'A')

@timlives  you wanna hang out tonight? Since I don't work tomorrow.
Na, we'll probably hangout for most of tomorrow though
Oof. Am hurt.
Holly hell dudes
Free for people who already own guerilla. I know what I'm doing tonight.
A reminder that this exists.  @timlives
7 months later and I still feel bad about pulling a Rob on @timlives
What'd you do, promise to take him somewhere and not?
tell him your dick was too big to get out of bed?
burgy pls?
What'd you do, tell him you'll pick him up, and then drive past him in the rain, twice?
twice
:yuukoPLS:
my dingus brain said to work on another setting, I dunno if I want it to be something for D&D or a totes OG thing ~~to be homebrewed later~~
No I invited him over for a new year's party. Then fell asleep.
He stood outside my house for like 20 minutes waiting to be let in.
And I was like 10 degrees out.
fug
at least you had remorse instead of saying "I thought you were some random girl and didn't want to stop in the rain."
like, I thought that was him but he didn't stop, otherwise I would have walked over and flagged him down, but like, he was in a car, what the fuck would rain do?
Oof
he slowed down just a little and then zoooooooooomed off
didn't even make a 2nd lap

Yo @timlives you and your dad be over here at mimis at 15 till 5
@timlives I drew a 100% accurate Astrid
but yeah like 90% of the images I had seen of Ozen were like this, so I thought that was just her default look, not a creepy exaggeration for when she was being a creepy psycho bitch
the other 10% were this
Friends.
Join me in the speechy chamber.
Btw
Would that be an upgrade for Kim @timlives
FRENDS
fuckin' called it
seems accurate to me
Beach Seraphine. now you know how her hair looks with the curls all soggy
mvp cloud in that seraphine drawing
fuck
but also same
so I think I came up with a decent prompt for a JRPG. Princess's Right hand man becomes her literal right hand after shit goes awry. Some evil dickwad needs her family ring, she won't hand it over, he decides to *cut* to the chase and take her entire arm off. She wakes up, and some wizard guy is all "Yeah uh you and your bodyguard were bleeding out so I fixed it, kinda." So then you got a princess with a magical sapient arm on a quest for REVENGE and to SAAAAAAAAAAAVE THE WOOOOOOOOOOOORLD
@timlives

I was informed my last RPG idea from yesterday was the plot of a manga, which doesn't surprise me. PLAN B THOUGH, from a mechanical standpoint I think I an idea I wanted from way back has been sorted
a"Megaman" format RPG
can do sets of bosses any any order (may do waves of 4 like some later megas) and each boss defeated gives you an equipment piece that changes your class. Each boss you beat causes the other areas to scale in power as they have more time to gather strength. Allows for lots of replay value ( '^')üëå

I rolled and you get fuckin uuuuuuuuuuuuuuh, Sif, and Gavlon
I don't care what we get, but either @timlives or @Trin has to be Solaire. Probably @timlives.
@a ghost with purpose I could see either you or I as Artorias.
You have the height for it.
@Demi Tarot Clearly needs to be Ciaran, Artorias' maybe-kinda' waifu. :^)
Uhhh. Kinda' wanna have @a ghost with purpose do Andre now.
I'm feeling Big Hat Logan or Ornstein, and oooh -- @timlives could be a good Big Hat Logan too.
more like Big Slat Logan....cause he makes venetian blinds for the gods who are really tall
@mannie.exe I'll take Smough üëå
Alright. Ducc Souls character combos:
@Koala: Smough
@a ghost with purpose: Artorias, Andre
@timlives: Solaire, Big Hat Logan
@Demi Tarot: Ciaran
@mannie.exe: Ornstein, Big Hat Logan
@Trin: Solaire
I haven't even fully considered DkSII+ characters.
Mostly Gavlan.

Hmmm

but i d k
im hella annoyed tho, dont think ill ever do custom build ever again
xd
My prebuilt is fine. Who did you buy yours from?
no no
I meant I'm going to do prebuilt next time
If it turns out to be something simple I'm gonna rofl
Generally what it is, ain't it? @Koala
meh
not sure what "simple" thing it could be
That sucks my dude. Really fucks with the hyped excitement.
ahhhh
I just dunno whats broken
really hoping its not the mobo
ye
I would have a look but I'm car-less.

@timlives  @Koala  @mannie.exe  any monitor recommendations? lookin fer a third one
noooo clue
If I had to buy one right now, I would just browse Reddit for some obscure deal.
@a ghost with purpose depends on what you want
...or spend a day researching the pros and cons of every configuration available under the sun until I felt satisfied with something.
something to browse reddit
$100-150 bucks
So, 1080p, probably no more than 60Hz, seams don't matter...
Can probably find something on /r/buildapcsales
yeh
Yeah. That subreddit should help fo' sho'.
@Meko
Turns out my monitor is on sale for 150 again
1440p 60 Hz IPS thin bezel. No frills like freesync or anything but hey its 150 bucks
It's quite a nice monitor actually
Lenovo L24q
On lenovo.com
@a ghost with purpose
Also what is your parts list
oo
its gud
compaq is the only pc.. change my mind
@Koala
i bought 32gb of ram but the 2nd set didn't work
so gotta take it back
also this harddrive not the other one
for the 2tb
But can it run Space Cadet pinball

uwu whats this
WHAT THE FUCK ACTUALY EPISODE 26 OF CRIT ROLE?!?!?!
_**AGHHHHHHHHHHH**_
It's so fucking hot out.
I'm literally sick from the heat. I'm so happy I don't work weekends.
Uh
You need water bruh
If you're literally sick from the heat, that's bad
Yea I think the coffee monsters didn't help
Like I feel nauseated
Like, you need to gtfo of the sun right now
Because that's heat stroke
Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are made more likely/worse by caffeine
And lack of water
Yeah it's lunch right now and I'm sitting in the office out of the heat. But I just feel light headed and nauseous
Those are literally symptoms of heat exhaustion
Oof
Guess I'll die
Pls don't
When I was a mechanic's assistant they beat us over the head with stuff like this
And made sure to provide water and sports drinks, which I'm pretty sure is OSHA mandated
Yeah when I was in the military it was the same way. They treated us like shit 90% of the time but if someone started showing signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke, they dropped everything to make sure that person was alright. They even taught us the codes to call out if we saw someone with those symptoms. But here at the street Dept they just don't care. If you can't work they just send you home without pay.
Fuckers
Yeah it sucks but it's money. And if I kill over at least Kim will get decent money lmao
Lol
Well, at the very least make sure to drink plenty of water
If you're out in the sun, should be like 5-8 ounces every 20 minutes.
You'll have to piss but that's better than dying of heat stroke
Yeah
Idk how bad it is but the Street Dept is obligated to take certain steps to mitigate heat risk and stuff
www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatstress/prevention.html

let's sue 'em
Also, that link 404's for me. @Koala

I bought dis
why buy a TN
huh
it's a TN panel on that monitor
i dunno what that means
ah i have done my google research
Because i had a 180 bucks to spend and it was the best deal
')-b
basically i wanted to try 1ms delay monitor to see if i could notice a difference
compared to like 5 ms or something?
Yeah.
I reaaaally doubt it but I guess we'll see
and since its my farthest monitor 27in seemed nice compared to 24, plus its 75hz
i really doubt it too but who knows
not bad
you gotta get a bigger desk now lol
seems crazy to me 2 ram sticks are the same price as that monitor
i have a table cmon
I need an actual desk lol
need to buy a mic stand and an arm for my mic too

I'm on top of all the quality memeage
I saw it yesterday and didn't think to save it then couldn't find it again till just now.
Yoooo @timlives  you need to get Bring To Light for your Oculus

my free memes...
@Demi Tarot
k I just finished far cr y5
and holy shit that game is bad
Lol
just
the ending
was
so
bad
Yeah I heard that the ending was kinda weird
Its not bad. It's just designed so that you lose either way.
There's no good ending. Similar to the final destination movies
it doesnt matter if theres "no good ending"
the story is just shit
the characters are paper thin, the gameplay is repetitive, enemy types are lazy and boring, and the writing is mega cringe
every set piece encounter feels like utter :mathsquadHorse:  :mathsquadGM:
@Koala  the ending is basically a redundant  choice into disconnected bullshit and predictable sequences into the final ending which is big bad evil guy going, "Haha, I was right all along."
I would cross the street if I ever saw a couple wearing these walking my way
I asked Kim if we could get those.
She said no.
I'm still getting the ahegao socks
Now that I've explained what it means she said she might want the shirts.
Lol
Yaoi is two dudes right and Yuri is chicks? Or do I have that backwards?
yuh
yeah that's right
Ok I'm explaining anime terminology to Kim
You mean, hentai terminology
really testing her commitment to that "til death do us part" aren't you.
Exactly @Demi Tarot
And listen Stephan. Ain't nothing wrong with yaoi holes.
I ain't saying its wrong

"Team player dedicated to customer satisfaction. Aims to meet the needs of consumers and employees by keeping the work place organized and clean, and offering advice and information as needed with enthusiasm and politeness. " how does that sound?

Lol so the stories I've read are true lol
I was then Catholic for three weeks for the little boys.
I mean wat
Aaaaaand we're back
Oof. The edgelord shall never change.
Deadass kayn and aatrox need a line that says "I am the ultimate edgelord. The edge of the blade Lord." It's completely cringe worthy.

Would if I could.
By the time I pay a lawyer, I'd have no money left anyways.

This has happened before. There's been times it's taken up to two days to get our pay.
pretty annoying
Like we're supposed to be paid by noon on Tuesdays, and sometimes we haven't gotten our check till Thursday morning.
No direct deposit, huh?
direct deposit is the future
Doesn't matter, the guys who get direct deposit haven't gotten theirs either.
They're just breaking the FLSA

Ah fuck looks like I'm buying it
It's like if WoW was a good game mixed with Dark Souls like combat, but deeper
It's literally like a Dark Souls boss fight simulator
plus exploration
It's my game of the year, so I'm a little biased
as much as I feel people using Dark Souls as a comparison for everything is overdone
this is probably one of the few instances where it's accurate. It's about patience and pattern recognition, if you get greedy you're gonna get your ass beat
Plus the story is super fuckin weeby and stupid
cats are there
I have seen the cats
Yeee that's why I try to compare it solely to DS boss fights
I've seen stupid weeby shit the plot ain't that weeby and/or stupid
Better example, it feels very similar to Dynasty Warriors story
Just super campy? Sounds fun
Dynasty Warrior's story was literally a famous book that's been retold by like 50 games and 20 animes
I meant style wise. In yes, it's very campy
fair I guess
man, I'm sounding really snippy for some reason
Monster Hunter is a retelling of the Bible
Your palico is Jesus
You're good. I suck at words so it doesn't come across right
I thought the plot was a bunch of ecologists were like "Yeah, we don't wanna/ can't kill this giant volcano dragon, but if it wakes up this island is FUCKED so we need you to convince it to fuck off into the ocean"
Yeah it is, but the way it's done is very over the top and taking itself super seriously while you're adventuring around with a talking cat that calls you 'Meowster'
also I'm tired and pissy because I went out to get my medicine and get mom some coffee creamer, and when I went to check out the creamer I apparently left my medicine on the counter when I walked off
we called to see if anyone found it and brought it back to the service desk or the pharmacy, but they said they didn't but would call if they found it. I didn't see it in my car at all, and it wasn't in the bag I brought in
:/ Damn I've done that before. I'm sorry man
like usually leaving the house takes all my juice anyway, but this like, left me at a juice deficit
I'm a raisin

If only I knew!
@timlives
I had a weird dream where we were trying to start up another RPG thing, and like, because dream logic this somehow translated to things appearing as a 2D platformer thing, but we were able to move our consciousness to the characters, which turned it into a First Person thing with 3D graphics. Only it somehow messed up and the controls stopped working right, so I took over for someone who was underwater, but my attack and jump buttons were unresponsive and I ended up getting my head stuck in a gap and couldn't move and couldn't breathe so I panicked and woke up
any of you dudes on and want to play hunt showdown?

Are you a rich lad, smart lad (scholarships), or a loan lad? @Koala
yes
yes
@mannie.exe if grad school goes as planned then I'll be a govt lad
oh nice nice
special scholarship by the national science foundation in exchange for work at a govt agency
My mom has been attempting to land gov't jobs for a minute. She's looking forward to have her student loan forgiven by working there -- for a decade.
still work, still loan forgiveness
ironically learning it balls deep in a college course. Student Loans are fucking bullshit and are the single hardest form of debt to get rid of
like I don't even think bankruptcy gets it off your back
especially if they're private
Yeeep.
at least Federal loans give you more options
haha just pay for them üòÉ
I'm not sure if this is true, but my mom once told me about how it's possible for a dead person's student loan to still stick around for reasons.
Not just because it was co-signed by somebody else either.
I would not be god damn surprised
ye if they reanimate still in debt
I'm fortunate enough that while I am taking student loans, my parents are using them as a means to avoid paying a lump sum every semester
are your rents helping u with grad school too?
yeah, it's part of the reason why I'm going to grad school right out of undergrad
My dad is gonna retire in like 5 to 6 years
nice
and, is everything goes as hoped, I'm going to get the govt to pay for school
so my parents don't have to pay for tuition
hopefully uncle samuel doesn't cuck u on that one
in exchange for the scholarship I basically agree to intern and then work for a govt agency
so Uncle Sam gets my labor

hhhhhnnnnnnnn
Have you listened to "SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK" by Joji yet?
Haven't kept up on his discography since "will he" from earlier this year tbh.
@Deleted User
SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK is pretty amazing. Sounds a little like Post Malone at points.
One of the best tracks I've heard this year. Not because it's overly relatable or catchy, but because parts of it legitimately blow my mind.
YESSSSSS
ITS FUCKING AMAZING
Have you heard the new Chainsmokers album? "Sick Boy... This Feeling"?
I'm listening to the second to last song on the album and I've straight up loved everything so far.
you think that would be good enough for kims pc?
Sure. Comparable to a Wester Digital Blue 1TB.
As far as technical specifications are confirmed.
the WD blue 1 tb is actually a dollar cheaper lol
plus two day shipping with prime
o lol
Just get the WD Blue then.
Cheaper and comes quicker.
Unless you want this for some fucking reason. *ivFEQ&sourceid=01643789331433319002&affillinktype=14&veh=aff
wut
the fuck is that
yes
More expensive on both Newegg and Amazon.
so
do you think a 580 is a viable upgrade from the 380 for kim as well?
price vs performance wise?
hm
Probably? But with modern hardware, drivers, and games in mind, it's hard to say. It might just make some games playable where as a 380 is probably too far gone.
idk it might be great. It's still an X80.
those are the two cheapest options
theres also an asus one for 225
Hm. The 1080 is just double that price right. So maybe we can find you two a better GPU than the 580.
Let me have a look, if not, I'll help you select a 580 instead.
You're looking at the weird time when a new gen is juuuuust about to start rolling out
Yeah the 20XX series is supposed to be great.
or something
There is a 1GB decrease in graphical memory (3GB instead of the 580's 4GB), but I think that's easily made up for by better driver support, newer architecture and base technology, and the 23.38% clock speed increase.
@Deleted User ^
Ass Creed Odyssey is out
I had no idea
i missed those messages yesterday. oof
i heard the 2070 will be somewhere between the 1080 and 1080ti in terms of speed for a price between the 1070 and 1080. so im looking at that
but rtx line apparently only has about a 10% power increase compared to pascal.
the selling point isnt the performance increase but that lighting thingy they added

I would have to know exactly what happens when it powers off to begin to imagine if I could even help
Ah ok lol
There are just so many things it could be it's hard to tell from just the symptoms. It's probably something stupid and easy to fix though.
@here AHHHH
what xD
crap what was that game I downloaded on GoG again?
Shadow Warrior.
that says fork knife
Correct.
Downloading Shadow Warrior 2 if anybody else wants to join.
I'll download it, dunno if I'll play tonight tho

and its lit
@Deleted User YEET
you play it @Koala ?
You bought it at a bit of an odd time tho, there's going to be a profile wipe very soon
lol
AND
there's supposed to be a sale in like 4 days @Deleted User
ooooof
@Deleted User glad you're enjoying it tho
its fun dude
already skull popped some full geared players
dab
my buddy killed a guy who had a scoped supressed mosin and let me have it
already gotten 4 kills with it since this morning when i got it
Mosins are definitely the low level move rn lol
that, and SKS
:dab:
i dont like the sks tbh
those are going to form the base of your loadout until you get to lvl 15
i prefer the AK-74M
more modibility
AK 74 variants are good, but you can't buy decent ammo until you get Prapor to LL2
be sure to complete quests
already working on it lol
I'm a mid-high level atm so if you need something specific I might be able to buy it for you, mainly weapon mods, and I've got a decent stash of trade goods
you able to play rn?
not atm
ah ok
@ me when you get on man and ill deff play with you
later tonight, I have dinner and then stuff to do for class
my friend and I are playing pretty actively tho, and I'll @ you
YEET
wait, USEC or BEAR?
I'm USEC
BEAR all day erryday fam
noooooo
but it doesn't matter
oh ok lol
you can group up with whoever you want lol
ah ok good
it does affect certain quests later on, like you gotta get X amount of USEC kills on Y map and so on
ahhhh ok
but early levels and quests don't need anything like that
im getting these friggin shotguns and body armor rn
the MP-153 is bae
keep those, just sell the others
Saiga shotties are good once you can mod them
the 133 is what i need for quests
That too
but you only need 3 and you can literally just buy em from Skier lol
my friend killed a scav that had a saiga with a NV scope on it lmao
lmao
like that big gray one?
thing is fucken terrible lol
Lol
Found our next D&D plot boys (and girl)
welp
fuck that game
i just lost a tri zip full of fully modded AK's and a fully modded M4, plus the AK and Mosin on me to a hacker
dude just appears in front of me, i shoot a full mag into his face at point blank range, he wiggles and tbags, then when i run away from the cargo container i was in, he starts shooting and i just drop, eve nthough he was still inside shooting with a 9mm
@timlives  YOU HAVE FUCKED UP
also was wondering when this would happen
@Deleted User
henlo
WHERE THE FUCC YOU BE @Koala
Whom'st'd've the fucc eat ass?
Michael
same
thats great
this is the best creepypasta I have ever experienced
Tarkov is fuggin gay
Lol
Get done dirty by the game?
@Deleted User
Bruh
I experienced my second speed hacker
Killed a full kitted 4 man with my MPX I pulled off of you Stefan. Or your buddy, can't remember who had it.  Was looking last body, and even though I had comtacs, some guy was able to Sprint right up on me without me hearing whatsoever. It was either that or I just got Tarkoved because of beta bs.
I had three M4's an AK, and an M1A with a thermal scope.
Plus fort armor, an opscore helmet with the fact mandibles, and a pilgrim pack.
Lmao
That's rough
Tarkov giveth, and Tarkov taketh away
Such is life
Most likely he just managed to sneak on ya
I mean I had Comm Tacs.
I should have been able to hear him. But I have been having sound glitches lately
Like earlier on factory, there was a glitch with a guys supressed M4 where the sound kept going even though he wasn't shooting, and I couldn't hear anything else.
i regret adding that emote
next campaign

@Koala I have a little more than a week before i can get it
And then you can finally play the game lol

Appreciated.
Hey kola. I love you
That big ghey love

How's EFT treating you
Haven't played it in like 3 days
I swear reddit is either fucking haunted or they were expecting me, because I broke down and made an account and it automatically subscribed me to r/Animemes and r/Osugame.
Lmao
Man Jojo pt5‚Äôs ending theme is hella whiplash inducing
why the fucc no one ever in voice chat now
Because these nerds don't follow coherent daily schedules (~'^')~
And I'm always doing something else

@everyone  Maple Story 2?
Why is this in my discovery queue
me messaging stphen
flip the zero two pics and you've got it

so apparently homosexual prostitution is legal in Japan because they don't consider homosexual relations to be "true" sexual conduct. So there you have it. Traps are ain't gay *by law*

You ready to sell whatever remains of your soul yet, Jared
this isn't new to me, ask Andrew
...have you drawn an obese skunk?
yes
did she pay well
yes
that's good
like my standards of what I won't draw are pretty small, but no one I know's really asked
okay, I'll bite
What _won't_ you draw?
scat and watersports are a no-go,
Yeah I'd say that's pretty reasonable
you know what they say
bidness is bidness
the new soul calibur seems great
...is that a real price?
I dont think those are American Dollars?
Might be pesos
Might be dirty foreigner money
Amazon recommended that light novel Jared posted and yeah that price is in USD
lmao
so you bought it rite
Bruh
Im sad and lonely niggas
I need friends to talk to in VC!!!
okay
get in here

@timlives
Lads, I miss D&D
same
also @Koala  fuck you
@timlives :gotem:
:fug:
welp, I don't trust myself to DM shite
same
Dnd would be cool but I don't have time
I can make time to play but I don't think I could manage enough time to prepare to dm
I've had ideas, but usually the execution crumbles, usually in terms of map making
suppose I'll just have you all quest in abstract voids
forgotten realms, abstract void same thing
GUYS
IM ABOUT TO DO SEX ON A WOMAN
no dungeons, so I suppose I'll just add more dragons to compensate
WITH CAT EARS
you have cat ears or she has cat ears
Was just about to say
It's her not me xD
I'm living every weebs dream. Suck it nerds
I would love to play dragons & dragons
Michael you got the cat ears I sent you right?
:rolf:
what
I'm stealing that
Also nothing Michael NVM xD
Michael isn't a woman no matter how many times you dress him as one
Listen
If I shave hit butthole
His*
It will feel the same
Actually
Kim never shaves her bhole
was considering something either fairly classical in fantasy terms
or doing something Wonder related again, but not a one-shot
So it'd be about the same
I would be down to play either of those
Oof :(
classic thing, not sure yet
Wonder thing would either involve a reprise of another campaign I attempted a while back, "The Cursed Princess"
or one involving a Fasolati village uncovering a set of ruins while excavating around, and sending some adventurers to check the place out
yeah just let me know if and when you decide to play
who else would we play with, mannie is dead, andrew is a pro streamer, mike disappeared, and stefen is gay.
Fuck me I guess
still thats two people
I'd assumed the pungent odor of Dangans and Durgons would summon NuMike once again and possible Jade by extension
Is it DnD?
If so, Kim might join as well
yeah
if I'm getting new people, might be best I stick with something close to standard. Having to explain all my bullshit on top of the rules would likely be an overload
Yeah I feel
I guess since ideas are still vague atm, the go to for planning is to see what the players want, but if you have no real experience hard to say
just watch üá© unkey

@a ghost with purpose Did you ever watch Castlevaina on Netflix
no
is it hotsauce
It is
But there's only like 4 episodes
Season 2 came out and it is very good
Also @Koala fuk you
@timlives :gotem:
Oh damn I can watch season 2 then
There is this fight scene where the music that plays is a orchestral version of bloody tears
That sounds metal as fuck
Wait nigga what
The fucc is my name?
REEEEE
:NoNormies:
:uganda:
so you're not a potato (mashed)
No.
Stewed
:dab: :dab: :dab:
well I just finished Castlevania Season 2
Hoooooooooleeeeeeeee shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
also SC isn't considered a Weeb Fighter
Weeb Fighters are stuff like Blazblue, Guilty Gear, Persona 4 Arena, Under-Night in-Birth, Princess Vanguard, and other anime lookin shit
Narutus
And Shonen Jump Superstars or w/e it was called?
well if it's an actual anime that's expected
Also nibbas join VC I'm booored
but eugh  that new Shonen Jump fighter looks gross
Mine and michaels friend tyler had one on ps4 i think
idk which one it was
someone made me in miitopia

Yup

Generation Kill is so fucking good
But the episodes are an hour long
it is
probably one of my favorite series
That and Band of Brothers
This fucking Lieutenant they call Captain America makes me want to fucking kill myself
He's literally retarded and not fit to lead.
I've seen 15 year olds in my milsim unit do better
"my favourite lore in dark souls is that Tarkus conquered an absolute death trap of a fortress that no one thought was possible to get through all on his own and then immediately slipped off some rafters and died"
Yeah that's an actual Captain
Oh is he?
No one is really memorable
yeah, not even an LT
I think they made it that way TBH. Because the show is a whole political thing.
Well it's from the perspective of the reporter, so you get him and the guys he was with
because the show was made based off of the article that the Rolling Stone reporter wrote
Ah I didn't even know that
Just got tired of hearing vets brag about how real it was and decided to finally watch it.
Deff worth 7 hours of my time.
definitely
Oh god
I'm still awake watching this
And I have to be at work at 7:30
UPS is a fucking joke
or fedex. whoever delivered those sata cables @timlives
they literally set the package down outside my door instead of in the box, rang the doorbell, and walked off
instead of waiting to see if anyone was actually home to get the package
they just left it there
if i hadnt been home, literally anyone could have stolen it
like what the fuck
disgraceful
reminder there is an Isekai where ~~Putin~~ The President of Russia ends up in a fantasy world
@Koala
I'll take 2
You niggas seen the New California mod for New Vegas yet?
I'm tryna download it now.
Yee
I'm literally retarded when it comes to manually downloading mods tho
I'm pretty sure you can just use Nexus
And their mod manager
I already fucked up my vortex manager
Because I fucked up the files and can't find them
fookin, laptop restarted so I lost my notes. Thankfully I wasn't in deep

yeah we can
Oooo
Civ
you guys know of any torrent sites still up?
because both kickass torrents and pirate bay are down
I use rarbg.to
It's pretty reliable, but probably doesn't have the same amount of content as TPB or kickass does
You can find the new popular stuff just fine tho
I found a tpb site
And torrented SAO Fatal Bullet lol
It's so fun
But the controls are kinda weird
As well as the fps drops in cut scenes
been playing Yakuza 0
it's just a fun time all around
when y'all wanna civ and do you wanna do 5 or 6
when ever is fine with me
anyone else want in/add some input
I only have 5 if I play
What time y'all gonna start
that's what we're trying to figure out
Because I wanna play more SAO after work for a bit
I'm down for it tbh
I wish you guys had HOI4 tbh
Because it's so much fun lol
Especially with the fallout mod
I'mma shower and maybe find a food, then we can figure out when to start
I get home about 4pm
So maybe like 5-6 would be good for me
that works
you up for some V at 5, @Koala
sorry but I'm gonna be busy tonight
there's a friend from out of town coming to visit
Free destiny 2 @everyone
Destiny 2 free for a limited time
In case you want another place to look for torrents, try  -- it's a torrent aggregator so it can usually find something if it exists on any other mainstream torrent site. @everyone
@Deleted User thanks
No prob
Wanna play this weekend?
Also thanks @mannie.exe

to watch this

I have no strong feelings one way or the other on the song, but that Akali is prime aesthetic
basically this
yeah that ^
honestly this is just par for the course for Riot being able to in house produce decent music
Riot Games is my favorite Record Company
this post got better
best dnd campaign
wow, so when Wii Fit Trainer was striking a yoga pose before getting blasted, that was actually her up-smash and she was trying to abuse an i-frame to dodge the laser. god damn

Yes

Heh
Michael when is your Thanksgiving break nibba
how much are your sketches jared ?
Thanksgiving
:facepalm:
basic ass sketches are usually 6ish cause Ko-Fi goes in increments of 3
okay I'll take a basic sketch of a little monkey with a big finger
Hmm.
I really want a random ass meme sketch now
Tbfh
done
Got it. I get paid tomorrow and I know what I shall request.
Jared how much for an anime catgirl eating a banana semi lewdly?
as a sketch or like, an actual clean piece?
Hmmm
Clean piece. I wanna set it as my PC background
15 for monochrome, 30 for full color
What is monochrome? Lol
are you stupid
...
Lines and shading, could just say Black and White, but if you're feeling saucy I could have it be blue or red or something
Ill go with monochrome. But before anything, can I usw my debit card on that site?
it goes through paypal, so yeah
Oof nvm
PayPal says I don't exist
how and why
I've tried half a dozen times to make an account and it keeps saying it can't verify me
is this Finejoubu
yeah that perfect
arigatou gozaimuch, my tomodudechi
O.o
That's really cool tbfh

that looks like a doggy red rocket
no, not like this thank you
good
ahh!! you got me good
good job

@timlives
>RPG About a Witch who summons monsters to do the fighting for her
or
>RPG that's based on the Largemen Rising plot, except not fucking retarded
I don't think the second one can be anything but retarded
I meant more keeping the plot where the main villain is an ancient weapon built with good intentions that backfired
because it was supposed to activate in times of crisis, and deactivate when not needed, but due to fear of being shut down it became a crisis to keep itself alive
that sound good. what would there other one be about. cause it sounds like pokemon but with hwiches instead of trainers
not sure exactly, but the whole summoning deal if just gonna be a thing the MC does, you don't just have witches all over the place trying to be a masta
but I'd imagine each monster has different XP curves and level caps and stuff, but you could upgrade some of them, or trade them off
and they'd have traits that help for exploring outside of battle, like smashing barriers, or flying across gaps
it still kinda sounds like pokemon
SMT did it first ya cuck ( 'A')9
you also make them instead recruiting them or capturing them most times
fair
You have any preferences?
not really. ether are fine
heck
how dare you make me read that
how dare you make me weeb that
@Demi Tarot  game engine wise godot feels really nice. much better than love
so if we make one it will probably be in that
I want one

So Goblin Slayer is really just a derailed D&D campaign that the DM is trying to get back on track
Every episode I watch is just reinforcing this thesis
you guys hear that Stan Lee is kill?
Yea
infinite saddo
What kind of jackass has to resort to blackmail to be able to shitpost
That said
Damn
He's good
I'm so mad
when you're excited but on a budget
god damn, apparently the person who worked on KDA Akali for Riot was overworked an promised promotions and a raise, and then got fired before the release party even rolled around
and the video wasn't in-house they just didn't credit the animators
Riot is fucking dog shit anyways
So
whenever I slap together a new commission ad

Yup
I know him from pizza thot
that's his recent thing, making a game out of it too I think
he also worked on something called Monolighter but  don't know much about it
oh that's cool
Even though nothing is moving, what is the illusion of movement for you? Sphere traveling through torus, or torus rotating while sphere stays still?
both sometimes, apparently how fast this thing "moves" is supposed to relate to how stressed or tired you are
I _exclusivley_ see the torus spinning now.
have you ate your vegetables today?

we ran out of hay, so Mom let the boys out to graze too, which turned out to be a colossal pain in the ass since even though we managed to keep the boys (the OG's since the male babies were never removed from the girl's pen) out of the pen, the one that was the biggest asshole completely ignored us offering him food so he could creep outside the girl's pen and make sounds at them. Had to drag him down on a leash, and the fucker headbutt me and tried to bite me.

It's different from BoB

Because it's based largely off of Eugene Sledge's memoir of his time in the Pacific
Yea
Instead of the accounts of a whole unit
Yeah it seems like based on a small handful of guys
Leckie, Basilone, and Sledge
Yep
What's bernthals guys name?
I think he's John Basilone, right?
Nah it was Manny or something I think

and
basically I took over russia, italy, and germany.
AS BRAZIL
also japan never attacked the US because they spent 5 years fighting china
so the US stayed neutral
oh and Italy and Germany surrendered in 1942 for some reason. Germany also never broke to pact with the USSR so the commies were still the enemy when they surrendered. So me as brazil, france, and the UK invaded russia and took it over.

I wish that would be enough
that's good thanks
i got you dog
unfortunately none of that helps
One this isn't an english paper so half of that stuff doesn't matter
Two  the only requirements for this paper is its 5 pages including references and about a bridge
quote bridge builders

he should have thought of that before he became a college professor then.

Do it

come up here
I already have a roommate, and @timlives wants @Demi Tarot to come up here too.
duh
Mannie i would live with you in a heartbeat man @mannie.exe
we could smoke hella devils lettuce
how close do you live to town, and what's the rent
I live in West Chester which is a 28~ minute drive to Cincinnati, OH. If we move in together, I'd recommending renting or leasing a house closer to Cincinnati/NKU. Being closer to NKU would help @timlives, and it'll also put us in toe with Cincy + surrounding area. The rent depends on where we look for a place + how many people we'd be looking to accommodate.
was gonna say if it's close enough to civilization I could probably grab a basic job, and if not could probably rustle up about 200 a month with commission money, don't mind doing extra on house work to make up for it.
though uh, can any of us cook? I dn't think we can all live off pizza rolls and ramen before dying of malnutrition
I can do a good breakfast, and if @a ghost with purpose comes with, we have a good meal for the night -- probably.
And yes. Civilization is definitely something I'm considering. Living closer to the city would give us access to public transportation and local jobs.
Which I'm definitely going to need one of, at least.
I'm being screamed at by goats, it's not 5 yet you spoiled bastards ( 'A')9
A goat can't time.
It just knows.
they know well enough to wander off and always be back at the same time to scream outside my window

Also! @deleted-role... did you know Wind Chime is an uncredited artist on one of the new Chainsmokers album? Check it out. He sings during the build-up.

so 5 with a bundle +1
Mhm. I'm thinking @Deleted User and @Kimmycub, and @timlives would want their own rooms, at least. That's 2+ a variable amount of rooms based on how the rest of us are willing to manage.
4-5 rooms?
I kinda need my own room for streaming also
@Demi Tarot more opportunities for getting accounting experience in this area as well
True.
I'm down to bunk with @Demi Tarot, but I think I'd need my own space as well as Jared.
That's five rooms.
Get one 9√ó9 Alaska King size bed
Hmm
Yall will fit
cram me in an attic
Theoretically manageable with six people.
or a walk in closet
pretty sure we're all broke af so we need to keep rent low
We could find a place with an attic or a basement, yeah.
like 200-250 ea i guess
idk if that works for everyone
Hmm
Well
First
We need jobs
^^^
im good
üòÉ
ye ye mr. mcstreamer
Like, deadass, we would all need jobs first. Nothing worse than moving somewhere only to not be able to find employment
if I could keep business steady 200 isn't too much, and moving wouldn't hurt that
*cough cough* me ND Kim moving to georgia
but it isn't steady
Yeah I feel
Well, with moving like this, what we need is savings so that we have time to look for local jobs.
I HAVE NO DISCERNIBLE SKILL OR TALENTS THO

of course you do you have a brain do eeet

"Goof Troop" is the best anime, which makes sense considering it's a spiritual successor to "Cory in the House" and designed by studios who shared a lot of their team with other classics such as "Suite Life of Zack and Cody" and "Sabrina the Teenage Witch"
**_DID YOU KNOW?_**: "Little Witch Academia" is actually a retelling of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch."

_This special broadcast was brought to you by: @Deleted User, @timlives, and @oooohitspdiddy#0420._
I think i just learned stuff
aight my SFW Tumblr seems to still be operational, only a few things got flagged, mainly a couple of commissions with too much PANK, but I appealed and they were allowed back, I think I have or two other flagged posts but I don't have the time or energy to track them down
also I'm still seeing some hentai, and pornbots are still around, so effectively nothing happened other than a lot of artists getting pissed and leaving
So nothing's *really* changed, but it's still worse and the staff exposed how pants-on-head stupid they are
expose implies it was ever secret
Exposed to the entirety of the internet? Rather than just tumblr?
again
Tbh I didn't know much about tumblr to begin with so this was all news to me
oh shit right I didn't explain stuff here
I mean you talked about it as it was announced and I heard from other friends too
a while back they tried to do something like this, by implementing a safe mode, where blogs could check themselves as NSFW, and people could turn on safe search to not find sensitive material. Again they had a shitty bot that didn't know how to flag shit.

Prior to the NSFW ban, they turned safe mode on for everyone and *hid* the ability to turn it off or unmark yourself as explicit. and by hid I mean, the text is still there but greyed out. if you open it in Inspect with your browser you can actually delete a single line of code to re-enable their function and untag your blog as explicit and it WORKS
also they didn't delete anything or ban people they just made anything flagged inaccessible to anyone but the owners
anyway, groceries and chicken await
Wow that's fucking stupid
Thanks Jurd
something funny I read about the NSFW tumblr bot, was that it was a single layer, two category, neural network which means it never had a chance in hell to work properly. A monkey with a hammer could have tagged post more accurately.
yeah someone mentioned that
like words can't express how little of a chance that bot would work
yeah they can
zero, nil, impossible, miniscule, microscopic...
any one with more neurons than that neural network could have understood that that wasn't going to work
according to a review from an ex-tumblr employee, a lot of the programmers are lazy, half ass something and leave the mess for other people to fix while they are moved to a new project (that nobody asked for)
normally their fuck ups are hilarious, but this is just obnoxious
do you know how hard it is to follow shit on twitter?
also I totally jumped the gun on that call to groceries
thought I heard mom pull up but it was Dad
but mom should be here any minute
help, I'm getting 75% packet loss on my pings to google, I'm "connected" but runnign at worse than dial up

Thanks that is now stuck in my head
maaaaaaan fuck this game, I'm only on the 2nd floor and it's asking some dumb shit, or I'm just lost.
only sensible way is blocked by digging ghost, who I can't understand and have no item for, so my only lead to go further is falling down a pit that goes to the 4th floor, which y'know gravity is a thing, and all the monsters down there are too strong too fight, I manage to run back to the 3rd floor but it's a spiral to the stair case and a monster spawns right behind me so either A) I fight a monster I can't kill or B, I get sandwiched between another group of monsters and this one so I have to fight two battles in a row, one of which I cannot kill
to further insult me all the monsters on the 2nd floor are chumps who don't give a lot of XP, s I can't grind until I can murder the downstairs monsters
puppet parts are too damn expensive for me to keep ramming my face into this ( 'A')9
well I cheated that, and ended up fucking up and falling down a different hole because it looked farther away than it actually was and fell like 4 floors and died on impact
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh
I tried looking it up, and everyone's all like "explore the 3rd floor until you get the ability to break walls" like, bitch, the only bit of the 3rd floor I've seen was an enclosed area that led back to the 2nd floor, I tried being sneaky and trying to avoid encounters while exploring the 4th floor and that got me nowhere except wasting my time.
"there's a spot you missed if you didn't unlock wall breaker yet" NO SHIT (v'^')v
"oh I figured it out, I had to complete a prior mission first." MY MISSION IS JUST "GO DEEPER"
What are you playing jurd
Labyrinth of Refrain
I have explored every square of the 2nd floor that is not blocked off by diggy ghost man, I have no found any other way to the 3rd floor besides falling down a hole to the 4th floor and using the stairs back up, but for some reason the game thought it was a cool idea to have monsters spawn behind you when you climb the stairs. So unless I randomly find another item that stops monster spawns again, I have no idea how to get back to that spot I was at
which, y'know, was the 1st floor because it went up 2 sets of stairs
so unless that eventually leads back down 2 floors again I don't know how the hell to "explore all the things in the 3r floor"
if the encounters weren't literally impossible, this wouldn't be half as irritating
WHO DOES THIS LIKE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME
4tu55f n5d8 in67biknyfukfyujrnvsrhdrjyvntdnrsjvrsnsnr I missed one fucking corner with the god damn stairs
I've passed these like 50 times how did I not see them
well for all my wasted time and anger, I was...rewarded(?) with  hot nun trying to force herself on the MC?
wtf is that
LOL
potatoes
see also
but yeah nah everyone is fucking thirsty for that witch, only like 2 characters so far haven't been all "yo girl I wanna ride you like a broomstick."

Have also heard of that. Not my cuppa, tho. Appreciate the suggestions

that guy wanted 4 emotes (  ' w ' )
AND THESE IDEAS ARE NOT CONCRETE
ONLY ONE IS
a guy commissioned four emotes?
not yet he hasn't he'll probably backpedal when I say the 4 emote bundle doesn't really have a "good price"
why did I say I was still doing these? I just want to draw cute girls
not try to decipher someone else's memes
Yeti
drew this design and realized this is just one of The Littles. God damn it
update on the twitch emote thing.
"sure I'll do the 3 for 30"
"alright which 3 did you want?"
"The two we discussed and I'll get back to you on the third one"
*looks at the four ideas he gave me
nice.
just draw two randomly and then gaslight him into agreeing
too much work
vigorous vibrations
accio, bum @timlives
I think I wanna get myself a Vive
I think your gay
are they cheaper yet @Koala
499 for a set
onice
go get 'em champ
mmmchamp
when I get home
you can also get a full Vive Pro set but I don't have 1400 bucks on hand
the pro is probably not worth getting over the regular one
or a Vive Pro starter set for like 1050
wat it do
"pro" ^
which is the pro headset but with regular other parts
the Pro is a higher res headset
and I think better sensors/tracking

like literally the point I said "fuck it, I'll take a nap" Mom popped in and told me to help with the hay
then sweep the mess out of the truck
then move my car
then told me I didn't do it right when I only stopped because I heard her shout something and was waiting to see what she wanted
she shouted at the chicken she said, but didn't clarify to pull up more, she just told me to get out and let her do it
so I'm covered in itchy
my sinuses are fucked
and I feel nauseous
>:c also sleepy
that's horrible

I got 45 minutes till I go back out and feed everyone, on the upside I only need to bring grain and water and don't have to fuck with hay for today

Thank you.
that's fan art, but apparently there is a legit Girls Frontline x Va11-Halla crossover

@timlives
neat
i mean, mood
I brought home a cello. @timlives
The low C-string broke 10 minutes later, and the endpoint stopper somehow rolled off the endpoint, and now the whole stick is inside the body of the cello.
This is a travesty, but I'm taking this as a challenge...
@mannie.exe that's a damn shame
ya
should have went for the trombone
NO
I think those were all checked out, tbh.
I was tempted to grab a sax.
I'm a little less fucked now: I removed the endpin through one of the F holes, but I still have a broken string (and a high A that I can't seen to get in tune).
I'm probably just gonna have to take it to a luthier to get the endpin reinstalled.
Fire^^^^
oh fuck is that P!ATD and GambiüÖ±üÖ±o?

I ordered a Vive @timlives
also @timlives after dinner we can reconvene Minecraft

gonna keep plugging at this drawing for a bit, tell me when you're done diabloing and I'll hop back over here to craft a mine
what the fuck
here I be
@timlives , I wait for ye
OwO
but it's Janu--ooooooooooooooooh
I apparently dropped from the call without a noise?
that was legit though
so my campaign
my players cruised through it way faster than expected, so it ended up being a one shot because the only way I could get enough content on the fly was to skip to the ending, someone blue screened before the conclusion
#JustDemiThings
that sounds really scuffed
was it still fun
they said it was a breath of fresh air from getting murdered
@timlives where do you get custom beatsaber songs from

@timlives as a Physics student how does this make you feel
from the day I first watched that it has and will continue to piss me off
I can't read Cyka, but this resonates with me

Are there any like, zombie themed DnD style games?
Or would it be possible to have a "zombie survival" themed version of DnD where the only monsters are zombies etc
up to the DM really
but given how popular Zimbo Apopoplips scenarios are I'm sure someone made one, and if not there are a handful of systems that are pen ended enough to model like that

607 and 405 mhz respectively

@Deleted User I would have to actually like see what it is doing to know if I can help you
If its bad enough we can use team viewer
well its making everything unplayable
it started with fps drops in RE6 that i noticed, and i used to play the game on ultra and get like 90-100 fps
i would have random drops to like 10-15 fps
and now its doing it even in league

is Divinity Original Sin 2 a Diablo esque game
I would not say that
but I'm not super familiar with Diablo
like, combat wise? no not at all
no, Divinity is open ended on abilities and uses turn based combat, and as far as I know not a lot of min maxing on item stats
it's also has more open ended conversations and junk
Think more like Dragon Age than Diablo in terms of RPG-ness

Hey wanna randomly join a branch of military together? It'll definitely kill us -- literally or otherwise. @Demi Tarot

@a ghost with purpose should join too. I think errbody else is too busy. üòÖ
nah it'll be great. Imagine escaping your life into hell, but you might get out of hell.

I think it's something similar but not quite, I only skimmed the tweet attached. it could be.
fuck i remember reading redwall
havent thought about that series in years
I like the idea of smoll things adventuring in a big world but I was never familiar enough with Redwall to play Mouseguard
I read the shit out of them books
i remember reading them, don't remember the books themselves
(and personally if I was doing a setting like that I think it'd be cool if they used like, nails and needles instead of having actually tiny swords, but that's just me)
i remember checking those books out at the liberty elementary library
good times
@Mujin how's sekiro
I have lots of thoughts that I don‚Äôt think I can write down before trying to talk through them
But if it‚Äôs any indicator, I stopped playing around 4pm today and I have 11 hours recorded already
9/10
The combat is incredible, but soooooo different from any soulsborne game
It‚Äôs been frustratingly hard for me to not try and dodge roll every attack cause that‚Äôs a one way ticket to pain and suffering
Overall the combat and game mechanics are essentially perfect besides some small gripes that I have
But I don‚Äôt give it a 10/10 cause it doesn‚Äôt capture me like bloodborne or dark souls does, cause I‚Äôm a fantasy and horror nerd and the Japanese setting just doesn‚Äôt hit me as hard
that's not very Kawaii of you Maiku-san
Which is really strange considering I was a ninja for Halloween for I think 6-7 years in row.
the mobility in sekiro looked pretty cool
i only watched a bit tho
As an example the music, while incredible and fits perfectly, just isn‚Äôt memorable.  While I had the boss music for every other soulsborne game stuck in my head after putting the game down
sounds like youre saying the game lacks soul
You mother fucker
I would highly recommend it, which feels so good to say about a new game at launch, especially after my disappointment with Anthem
definitely will be watching a playthru at least
did you play nioh?
Yeah, completely different combat styles. Nioh is more of a Japanese flavored souls, while Sekiro is more like a stealth rhythm game
interesting
tumultuous

@Demi Tarot @timlives by some twist of fate I found myself in Bell County today
how the funko pop
what the fuck
Lmao
how
I was driving back from a spring break trip to South Carolina
I assume you ran screaming immediately as any sane man would
so you took a wrong turn
The interstate near Knoxville was full of traffic, so Google maps diverted us to US 25 East
Im sorry
So we drove through the mountains a d the Cumberland Gap, and I found myself surprised to be in Bell County as we exited the tunnel
Tbh it was a nice day to drive through, 70¬∞ and sunny
Took this photo in TN
yep
oh yeah the overlook at clinch mountian
you probably passed LMU also
But yeah, drove through Middlesboro, Pineville, past Bell County HS, basically from TN to I-75
you basically took a tour through my life
Yeah kinda lol
Told my gf and friends that you all lived there
I'm 20 minutes past that big bridge next to the Gas Station
Was like "my friend Jared is on the side of one of these hills"
"god rest his soul"
"Lord help him get off it"
that mean you got too see all of middlesboro's attractions
Like the Food City
all 0 of them
littlerly every thing is on 25E
And the KFC buffet
(Also in Tazeville!)
the rest of middlesboro is resdential
yeah that strip of road you passed through is all there is, I constantly forget there's even buildings beyond it
tazeville is a little bigger than that
Middlesboro is a podunk town, but at least it's not half-cemetary like Pineville
right next to tazevile is new tazeville
you also saw the entirety of pineville
like there is nothing more to it
Yeah
Was nice sunny day, good for a drive on 25
Actually saved us a few minutes too
yeah just drive on by don't stop for the love  of god
Clinch mountain itself was worth it
if you want the true Middlesboro experience you need to show up on a wet morning where you can smell the god damn tannery for miles
the tannery isn't even there any more
that's the scary part
It's like Rob's ghost is haunting the place
That canal just smells like shit
and just goes nuclear
rob shit in the canal
Was gonna say, if it was anything but sunny then I imagine it would have been much worse lol
yeha
like middlesboro is alot bigger than what you saw, but there is nothing there
did you stop at the first kfc in corbin
Nah, it was in the afternoon
What's up with it
it has like a museum
for kfc
Lmao what
myyYYY
BAAAABIIEEeessss....
that editor's note
@Koala Hey man, I'm gonna need to know the next time you're down this way. üòÉ
@Trin I honestly didn't know where I was until I exited the Cumberland tunnel lol
Was like "Oh cool Kentucky" and then was like "Oh shit *Kentucky*"
Rabbit April Fools
Pop Team Epic did a TV special....there are 4 versions!
I've been spicing up the Boss Man's twitter all day with some drawings ( 'w')

Real shite desu

so happy for clark
this is the best story i've experienced in a while
also you forgot to post
I follow so many things it got buried before other things caught my attention
it's ok
Connecticut is a weird mysterious land
so this is the person that created the ~~squinty person~~ sock puppet meme
no that was futurama (' w')
fixed it
yes
and it catches me off guard when they draw actual anime bullshit instead of mspaint sock puppets every time
i eat ass
that is all
finally got a damn call from the loan company about my loans, figured they would have done that when the first payment was due and not like 6 months after, but whatever. I didn't remember the name of the company, I asked the school and they referred me to a site that wasn't really related and glitched whenever I registered, and I had neither a phone call nor a letter till today
so there's that bandage ripped off, for the loans in my name, which constitutes as 1 full year it totals to just under 29k. ( '^') college is some bullshit
if I pay 300 a month (which is probably more than I make on average with comms) I'll have it paid back in 8 years, naturally a job would accelerate this, but this is going to make saving up to move the fuck out a pain in the ass.
( '<') if they're hiring I might go for a job at the liquor store, since mom knows someone who works there, and its only a 20 minute drive as opposed to 50
That'll make saving up easier, hopefully?
that is assuming they need anyone

how do I lower my resolution
what program to do you to stream
obs
in settings go to video and change output resolution
it's at 853x480
what do you have your bit rate set to
200
set it to 150
it won't go lower
and change the preset to max proformance
is the 200 audio or video bitrate
video
cpu usage preset?
oh change output mode to advanced
on cbr?
no at the top
I mean it's in advanced
do I set it to cbr
rate control set to cbr is fine
for rate control
so is the CPU usage preset what you meant before?
I don't have a max performance but there is an ultrafast
what version of obs do you have
23.1.0
studio
it should just say preset
verry fast is fine
i forgot you cant use Nvenc
also I wanna put the rescale output to 360 right?
yeah

i think the bass is a little stronk
I like a good bass line, so it doesn't bug me
I'm starting to get a dope vision for this piece actually.
I need to refine the bass. Glad you like it though.
I think it's a little too complex to be a meaty bassline, but we'll see.
Listen to version 5 entirely -- this one isn't looped, it's arranged.
I'm like, 35% there.
owo whats this
some music I'm working on
uwu
please
don't infect me
nice, I like it
Still need to:
- design better bass sounds (ambient vs. bass line)
- split bass into melody support and ambience
- build a better arrangement (intro -> lead -> who-knows-what-outro)
- get some juicy drums (expand on the snare)
you're doing pretty well, keep it up
Thanks thanks.
Better mastering, better arrangement. Bass has become more muted since I haven't tuned it praperly.

Yeah don't do that
e.coli takes 3-4 days to begin
actually worried
I would say your steaks were probably fine, cooking a steak kills the stuff on the surface
The ground beef is the actual one to worry about
also cant tell because i feel nauseous /feverish anytime i eat
Uh
Because of your food allergies?
yeah
Are you allergic to beef now or are you doing dumb things like eating corn lol

and mayo

RE: Tifa's boobs
someone was going on about how there was an "ethics group" at Square who insisted they restrict the size, but that was a MASSIVE mistranslation, all the design team was told to do was give her a top that didn't have flop all over the place since she was an active sporty type and would probably keep those puppies on lock down, y'know, like wearing that sports bra she has. s( '^')v
It's like folks don't know what a fucking sports bra does
Although that makes sense if you think about the people who complain about Tifas jugs. Probably not very familiar with the other sex
and as I said before they're still bigger than Advent Children and KH incarnations
Oooh I wonder if we'll get an Advent Children remake now
pls no
The tech is so much better now
it seemed impressive at the time but that movie was a mess
and is kind of responsible for people seeing Cloud as an angsty bitch boy in everytihng
We should watch it together when I get back from Florida
Just drink and watch Advent Children
Because I don't think I've ever seen it aside from like ten years ago in 7 broken up parts on youtube
Oh dude. It was weird.
I watched it once out of the blue.
Years later, I found myself with a PSP and a copy of FFVII: Crisis Core.
I immediately watched Advent Children afterwards (I still haven't played the OG FFVII) and the movie made... still, no real sense, but at least I cried at the end when you see Aerith and Zach together.
Now that I've got a PS4 pro I figure I'll pick up the remake

oh dude how's that Pathfinder game? @Koala
@mannie.exe pretty fun. It's basically a DnD campaign. Scratches that RPG itch
it kind of literally is a DnD campaign though? just for people with no friends around
it is literally a singleplayer DnD RPG
using Pathfinder rules
I consider Pathfinder to *be* DnD since...it's 3.75 more or less
which game
pathfinder kingmaker?
ye
that game is way too much pathfinding and not nearly enough kingmaking
the kingmaking is like 2 chapters in

its just not enough realm management for me

>he's actually in the damn vodka aisle as I'm putting things away.
>I'm 99% sure that's Michael, but I figured he'd say something if he noticed me....wait it's Michael....maybe I should say something.....wait it's Me.
but it gets weirder
I saw FUCKING ROB
but I was in the freezer so he didn't notice me either
my how we've grown apart
‚ö∞
I'm sorry I did this to you
IT GETS WEIRDER STILL
I ran into someone else from high school, not sure you know him, and he came up to me while I was checking the box wine to see if any expired and was like "oh hey, you're the third person I knew from high school I ran into today, but the first to actually notice me!"
and he's just like "You remember that one guy? he died."
and I'm like " ( ‚Ä¢ u ‚Ä¢) damn son."
and then he got some beer and left
wow
I feel so bad for not noticing you
do you want to go get Chinese this weekend?
I'd be offended if
A) I didn't have the ability to just be invisible without trying
and
B) you have the spatial awareness of a fucking stump
I'm working tomorrow, Sunday should be fine if I'm back by 9, otherwise Monday is good
okay just message me sunday if you good other wise  we will work something out for monday

Oh yeah that guy

I had a dumb idea for a comic, and my brain kept insisting I draw it, so I did so it would work on better things
I chuckled
You should tweet that, it's pretty funny
I wasn't sure the joke would really land outside the group circle
It's got a Flork of Cows vibe to it
I suppose it's a good vibe to have
Either way I'll like and RT

thats really cool
Beat Craft.
I wanna play the game that lets me do the two things I enjoy.
massive beans required @timlives @Demi Tarot to pursue [REDACTED]
guess who got ran out of bed by the police because a pot garden was being grown just off our property~
Sorry about that
good news, they believed it wasn't ours (it isn't)
bad news is mom still had pot, so that got taken and she was slapped with a ticket
oh they searched your house
shiiiiit
not thoroughly, turns out if you're polite and don't make them go through the bullshit to get a warrant, they don't go through your cabinets and flip your furniture
u mean
u got lucky
lucky mom only had 4 plants, if you have 6 or more it's not a misdemeanor anymore
any further offenses and it turns into a felony
would have been hella embarrassing if I didn't let them in, and they got the warrant and assumed we were responsible for the mess, raided the house, had us detained, had dad's guns and my parents ATVs impounded and all sorts of trouble over 2 dead plants and 2 alive (but probably about to die) plants
I cited mom's poor gardening as proof we couldn't maintain jackshit in the woods
Oh I agree that your cooperation in addition to being reaaaaalll lucky saved your asses
all the stress I managed to hold off at the time is creeping in (\_v_)
You did good
yeah, but I only slept 2 hours
I'd like to sleep now but keep feeling like "ew no"
Wow that sucks.
wtf
sad @ the lack of nyandrew in this server btw
i dont like that nickname

hahahahahaaa congratulations @Koala

Thanks bud
@mannie.exe just watched the first episode. Left a very good impression tho
I watched the first episode as well. I kind of like it. I think it has potential. Other than a few gripes that I think might improve over time, I think the setting and characters are interesting. It's very fast though, maybe not my preferred method of storytelling in this case, but it's still awesome in some senses.
Let me know how it goes if you decide to continue watching! I think it'll be a while before I get around to it.

I switched to Discord light. @Demi Tarot
I have never been so enlightened before
you wearing sunglasses to look at it?
cuz sheit
it's bright
you fooru
i am the sungurrasses
fruit
I switched off of Discord light because they ruined it
then Twitch did the same thing
I like it so far. What's the difference?
you know how the sidebars looked in dark mode?
they were like that in light mode too, there was a nice contrast that had everything in nice blocks
then they were like "gray not light. make it bright!" and everything became an eye searing mess and it made everything just a big mess of white, and none of the server icons popped
dark mode is just a mess of gray that all runs together, but at least it isn't migraine inducing
Ahhh, I see. And I agree.
Contrast between conversation and the surrounding UI would've been nice.
Now it's just like

the guy who makes the 3D Jojo OPs made this vid
or so I heard, anyway
you're overlooking the fact that THIS IS A COUNTRY SINGER who made this album WHILE HIGH AS FUCK IN THE HOSPITAL
but it looks like his style
AND THEN MADE A FUCKING ANIME FOR THE ALBUM
there is no part of this story that isn't bat tits insane
I watched it last night, was pretty neato
but learning that he made it while jazzed out his mind in the hospital makes *a lot* of sense now lol
happy to have been exposed to Sturgill Simpson tho, he's a good artist
and I'm very much not a country fan
Here comes dat boooooooi

wait why did michael beat-up another angel because of that one Tenacious D song that might be a mythological reference too in which stan is musically fucked in Georgia?
To keep the secrets‚Ñ¢?
I think the other angle is Lucifer
ohhh okay, those are the two times he was fucked
yes
yes yes
alternatively Michael just really loves beating the shit out of angels
thanks, I saw it as a continuity, and not a 2-item list in-between the other two panels

also to illustrate how my brain operates.
I had lunch at Arby's because it was connected to Little Ceaser's and my parents wanted me to buy a pizza and bring it home....even though by that point it would be ice cold but I digress.
I was in a funk, so I was like "let's get a turnover as a small treat"
but another part of me was like "son, you don't need to be tossing out money like that."
after a brief argument, I ended up just buying a smaller combo and the turnover, so I got my treat and spent less money s( '^')z
is that how people brains usually work? Like wildly different bits of personality arguing with each other over trivial stuff?

Let's say you've been a bad girl. Let's say, hypothetically, you've been a naughty girl even. Ok, and if you were a naughty girl, you would be my dirty little slut right? Then hypothetically speaking, you would be my little cumslut. Now, let's say you're also daddy's girl.

Now that we have established that you are both a bad girl and daddy's girl, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that you deserve a spanking. Am I not correct? A bad girl deserves a spanking, and as I am daddy, you are my girl, so I am the one who must provide punishment.
Wet's say you've been a bad giww. Wet's say, hypotheticawwy, you've been a naughty giww even. Ok, and if you wewe a naughty giww, you wouwd be my diwty wittwe swut wight? Then hypotheticawwy speaking, you wouwd be my wittwe cumswut. Now, wet's say you'we awso daddy's giww.

Now that we have estabwished that you awe both a bad giww and daddy's giww, I bewieve you'd agwee with me when I say that you desewve a spanking. Am I not cowwect? A bad giww desewves a spanking, and as I am daddy, you awe my giww, so I am the one who must pwovide punishment.

I relistened to ‚ÄúUse This Gospel‚Äù and him opening with ‚Äúglad you waited‚Äù was funkier than intended
drew a friend's lady to test FAT TIDDY on this style
is the goal of the style just to do a chibi look with quick and easy coloring
it's not super quick and easy it's AESTHETIC
I'm trying to get something that looks nice, and is consistent
once I get the swing of it, I do plan on using more layers of color to make it more robust
but cutesy "hand drawn" looking things for bleak gothic settings are always in vogue
oic its like a development of those characters u drew for goth loli game
yeah, this is a style I'd use if I ever did those again
i dont think im a big fan of the aesthetic but for what it is, looks nice
you're not GOTH enough
I don't think thats it :OMEGALUL:
weeb goth
Liar Princess and the Blind Prince do a sketchy cartoony style for a kind of grim game
i can appreciate it, just not my favorite kinda style
that's fair
I really like the monster design in that game though, and the story is cute
the princess is a wolf, that apparently had a nice singing voice, and a prince is like "This girl has a nice voice, I wonder who she is." and the wolf liked the prince, but she was a wolf, so when he started climbing up there, they both freaked out and she accidentally claws his damn eyes out. So she goes to a witch and is like "I'll give up my voice so make me a human" so then she goes in human form to visit the Prince, who got locked away for running away or something, so she turns into a wolf and busts him out, then back in human form decides to take him to the witch to get his eyes fixed
so she has to escort the blind boy through a dangerous forest by switching forms to deal with puzzles and enemies, because she can't let him know she's a wolf
sounds p cute
I think the screenshot you linked shows some more detail to depth through line work, but I see the most of that in your pic in the shirt between the titties and the end of the scorpion tail ‚Äî which like, fair enough.
There‚Äôs not enough detail in the line work that conveys depth, so it feels like it‚Äôs just colored over. Depth is more apparent in your piece in the lighter regions, which is kinda‚Äô obvious because you have more raw values to work with, but that same technique doesn‚Äôt show a wide enough band of tones work in the darker regions.
Except you capture it well in the end of the scorpion tail, despite it being darker. The specular reflection gives it a real, spherical quality.
Gotta apply that around all edges throughout the rest of the geometries to show depth. You gotta emulate light a little better, it‚Äôs that interaction that sells this. @Demi Tarot
yeah, I was focusing on the structure more than the color for now, once I get it solid, I was gonna add more focus on the colors and color the outlines and stuff too
Sweet. Try to think about tones with shapes too, because generally they‚Äôre codependent. Best of luck with the second pass.
why
when i get out of bed and sit at my computer im tired as fuck
but when i lay down in bed im wide awake
end me
I gotta wake up in less than an hour for work
I was exhausted since I rolled out of bed, then I went to sleep at 2 and woke up at 3 and haven't been able to stay down since
oh yeah you have retail hell today
godspeed
mornings are super slow, I just kind of sit around till a customer buys something, then just immediately restock it
it doesn't pick up until about the time I leave
just creepily yet stealthily following behind customers
I'm a bit more subtle than that
--I mean
when it's slow I can sit up front and see what they buy from the register, I don't have to glance over while I'm grabbing other things to put in the freezer
are u pretty much by yourself
nothing to do + no one to shoot the shit with
go next
pretty much me and a cashier or two
but they're middle aged women
unlucky
fuck, now the sleepy hits
take drugs
sitting here waiting to start my car so it can heat up. the wait is murder (v'^')v
I was always early to class back when I went to LMU because I got antsy waiting for the right time to leave
early is good except for when its skull-crushingly boring
early is when I SLEEP
even if I did sleep before hand I always get tired as soon as the sun comes up
yeah fuck being awake right now
absolutely cannot imagine going back to like highschool morning schedule
god, having to wake up at 6 to shower and catch the bus on time
at least I could sleep on the bus, now I'm the one fucking driving
car rides also make me sleepy, driving while tired scares the hell out of me
and in the winter it's worse, since I need to turn the heat on to not freeze to death, but one time ONE TIME I left the heat on too high and it made me drowsy and I fucking fell asleep for one second, and have never felt safe again
yeah i feel that, I've dipped on class/work before to avoid driving after a 24hr
car accidents fucking spook me and I've not even had any bad vehicle experiences, cant imagine my paranoia if i were in your shoes
yeah after that one wreck, I still flinch if I see a car pull up on my right side too fast
I lost that car, and felt like a total chode, but I got off lucky, no one was injured
had to go to court because of the ticket since it was my fault, but that basically amounted to waiting in line for 2 hours for the judge to say "well your car got totaled, I think you learned your lesson, get outta here"
car defrostin' T-minutes 9 minutes till I leave

alright, let's look at motherboard manufacturers
wow wtf
$500 and $730 respectively.
back at it again at the scribbly cream
@Demi Tarot instant improvement
improvement in the tone variance across her blue skirt as well as the hair
but the light palette of hair might have too much orange (or the dark is too maroon)
I think you can definitely go further
the dark was meant to be maroon
ah then de-brown/orange the other tone a little and see how that looks
pretty solid improvement
I was thinking that I like showing value by the line density more than using another color over top of it
That‚Äôs a really good way of doing that. I see it in the skirt.
im a fan of Machete
the lighting is also nicer, but the right (from camera) bangs have too big of a shadow being cast on it from the hair over it
one final thing ‚Äî zoom in. take 3-4x times as long to think about surface qualities and textures and lay your lines in close, and if you‚Äôre not doing fine line work, don‚Äôt be afraid to switch to a larger brush
though keeping a uniform line size helps practice and keep the sketchy aesthetic, I think the design would flourish with more variation in ink size
also try additive coloring / color sculpting
you can always try to develop tones and shades before you recolor into a particular art style
understandably, most of this advice may be irrelevant to your current style
what are your goals for your current aesthetic?

I guess it hasn't been that long yet, but I still feel like (haven't) done that much shit today.
time is wack
I have a headache
It feels like it's going to turn into a migrain
I forgot to eat breakfast then ate 3 slices of pizza (at once)
I would like to be slain peacefully.

why does everyone love this shit
oh hey it's Rob shitting on the moon
that's piss you uneducated mugwort
no mugworts are too good because they're hot
and aromatic
mugworts are not my sexual fetish
man there are some fanatical pokemon fans out there
hasn't that been the case since the 90's?
yeah, but its an issue now because this pokemon is kinda bad
other than the massive cut to pokemon in it, what have people been complaining about? seems standard fare so far
dexit and removal of mega evolutions are the big things gameplay wise
but bigger than that people are pissed that gamefreak lied about why they decided to make those cuts
they basically said "we had to remove that content so we could focus on making new models and animations"
which has been proven false as all returning pokemon not cut are on the same model and only a few animations are changed
they also didnt even tell their japanese audience about dexit
just announced it in NA and apparently domestic japanese fans are pissed
I heard the main thing with the animations and junk not carrying over properly from SuMo was because the games coding was really sloppy
but that's just a thing I hear
what pisses me off is that pokemon is the highest grossing video game franchise and gamefreak is DOWNSIZING their studio instead of upsizing
so no surprise the games are getting smaller in scope
and people are pissed the graphics are barely being changed going from handheld to console
well that could be attributed to said downsizing
I'm just surprised Gamefreak is actually working on a new non-pokemon game for the first time in decades, but I don't think it should have split the staff that drastically
heard a lot of veteran pokedevs were working on that so some new people could go at Pokemon with a new perspective, though it doesn't seem all that new really
it stings a lil extra cause all the other nintendo ip had great titles so far on the switch
like, very expansive and innovative generally
compare ultimate's "every smash character ever made and a hundred more"
to this
is pretty lame
I always knew pokemon was eventually going to have to call it quits on including literally every pokemon, but they did it way too late and now everyone is expecting it, and the way they handled it seems really haphazard with no real pattern or rhythm. No previous gen starters except Charizard who gets a unique dynamax form after his punk ass got 2 Mega forms
Mega Forms were also something I was iffy on. They seem cool but again it only applies to a handful of mons out of hundreds
the issue is less the content being gone and way more their approach
"guys we need to cut back, we dont have the resources to include all the pokemon"
fuck off you guys are rich as hell
"guys we want to cut back, the story will be way better if we cut back and focus up"
ok dad
I don't even know if it's the resources so much as the practicality
I think we hit over 1000 this gen
gamefreak just actin hella scummy got me pissed up
this post and top comment sums up the pokemon stuff
how's that project thing @timlives

You got a plaaaaylist in mind, or some coooontent?
I have a few thing in mind but would mostly just  randomly pick from either recomeneded or memory
üëç
I will have to run an errand at an unspecified amount of time for 20 minutes but idk when that'll be
I miss Vi keybindings in Discord now, Michael.
alright it's dead, I was already setting the other one up but yeh @timlives
I had a dream that I saved Michael from being murdered
I apologize
rats
how's it bleeding Jared
I want to die in the process of making a video game.
I don't want to start. I don't want to finish it. I just want to be making it, and then never wake up.
have you tried starting it?
have you tried-
yes
once you start, you won't be starting anymore
That would be so cool if I didn't definitely start a bunch of times already.
something I do a lot of times is leave my stuff open, so I don't have time to second guess myself during the boot up process
:D
that's wicked
it works pretty well
guess I could just read that one book I started
definitely want to second-guess the book choice all the time because I read each one so slowly -- because I second-guess the book choice each time
fuck
alright, do... find a way to develop a video _rn_ do I read _the book_.
damn
damn damn damn
jared
tell michael to get alcohol for the weekend
I mean, he'll see it when he's here
but will he?
will he jared?
what does it really bean to see?
v( '^')v
see, i believe you believe that he believes that we believe that at least i believe that i believe that you'll see michael more than i will, but what do you believe?
what server is this
can't even recognize it anymore
Are we animeing tinight?
Not sure if I need to buy more rum
What were you thinking of watching?
I dunno, but I bought another bottle anyway
@timlives what do you say?
I don't know
my god
do you need a drink of water my guy
a drink of some succulent h2o
cuz i have apples but not grapes
wat
Omg
Magical Sempai has an English dub
what were we watching last time
I know we finished Inferno Cop, didn't we move on to something else?
I think so. I think you, Michael, and maybe Stephan started something? Was in the mangaka anime?
rip Mushi-shi
oh yeah, Nozaki-kun
that one
I watched some episodes of Turning Girls yesterday
That was interesting.

is that the kung pow penis man?
I don't think so but you used to share his tweets about anime or something and I ended up following him
wait
yes
those were probably by accident
yes he is
he's one of those guys that just seems to show up on every post, and I don't realize it until someone says kung pow penis
lmao
he spend a lot of time on twitter
he has decent takes on stuff for the most part
yeah, despite him constantly getting ragged on, I don't see a lot of stuff that really warrants it
he also spends as much time complaining about the tumblr/twitter folks that complain about everything having a "x problem"
on the whole he's been a good, entertaining follow
feels good to be home

damn it
>when I'm complaining about something inconvenient and someone tells me to "look on the bright side"
this is some dystopian social shit
fucked up comment -- useless automatic social reply
Happy cake day!
Maybe. There is nothing wrong with being tangential, but I wish people did that less when they didn‚Äôt just know what else to say.
I dunno if I'm just jaded, but I just get really : | when I get a bunch of birthday wishes from people who haven't spoken to me in years and then they continue to not speak to me for more years
also get really **: |** when people get MAD at me for not being super duper excited for my Spawning Day
I don't even tell people my birthday anymore, I don't really hide it, but like, I don't flaunt it or nothin
Exactly. I find it‚Äôs better for me to find my own need to celebrate my birthday than have people around me be excited for me. Kinda‚Äô defeats the purpose sometimes, though often it‚Äôs like ‚Äî man, I wish I could share your enthusiasm.
not to mention, like, if you don't do anything for it, and have nothing to really get excited about and people are like HEY HAPPY, BE HAPPY, WHY AREN'T YOU HAPPY, it's really god damn stressful like "fuck, let me live my life, that's my present to myself."
fuuuckkk, that‚Äôs triggering me. I think people are afraid of unhappy people. They recognize their own happiness is fleeting so they try to convert everybody else. Like couldn‚Äôt I just be ‚Äúokay‚Äù on my birthday because I know it‚Äôs meaningless but cute and that I‚Äôm working on my own goals and milestones and reserving my happiness for what I really care for? Rants aside, forcing others to feel any way is kinda‚Äô annoying. I don‚Äôt need a fucking hype man. I am my own hype man. I just don‚Äôt wanna be hyped right now, but thanks I guess for making me feel worse. üòÇ

why in the fuck has that rainbow dash thing become relevant again?
memes never die
unless a corporation gets a hold of them
I don't think hasbro is touching this

a Book is a taco, prove me wrong
Tacos don't have bindings along the bottom to hold the fillings in
Putting something like sour cream or cheese along the bottom isnt the same either as book bindings connect through the cover

no
And I lose myself in gravity sort when we kiss. Do you know why they also call gravity sort, "bead sort"? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) @timlives
I'm asking him to watch an LP with me of a Lisa fan game
for context so he can watch a playthrough of a fan mod of said fan game
an endeavor which will take about 6 hours total for a payoff that may or may not be worth it

"this is so ironic it loops back around to not being ironic"
I didn't think you'd do anything with it. I'm proud of you, thank you.

yeah you blue me, so I had yeeting privileges
Ohhhh you

*pip*
well the zones were named
"Where we Speak" "Where we Write" and "Where we Dream"
and I was like...."no...no no...no...anywhere but here."
Yeah Michael barely does any of those things and half the people lost the dream and joined IRL, partially including myself.

Darren looks 34 but otherwise seems to be doing alright
I saw him in person a week or two back
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thought he looked in his mid-30s.
I‚Äôm guessing Jared and Michael are playing Dungeons and Dragon.
Director of IT for a school district is pretty good. Sure it might still be Pineville but it's better than selling used cars like he used to lol
honestly Pineville is the better school of those avaiabile in bell county
I'm happy for him
ye i would say hes doin' alright for himself
hope hes happy in life
Hey Michael. I wrote a sentence that essentially asked if you wanted to watch something but it was pretty homosexual. So here is this instead.
boi did the real life before the rest of us
concern
The sentence, not what I wanted to watch.
Speed runners have a different sort of enjoyment. Not entirely interested.

orange man actually got impeached
will the senate actually yeet him? who knows
i doubt he will be yote
but the impeachment itself is a big deal
Nah, McConnell and the R controlled Senate won't actually remove him
Also the House has to actually send the articles to the Senate for them the start the trial
So Pelosi might just...not send them in for trial

so I was designin' a fantasy race again because I have a problem. And I was having issues landing an aesthetic or theme with'em, so I just kinda took what I knew and pondered what they'd be good at, and asked other people and a lot of stuff surprisingly fit well with stuff from India ( '0')
they long and they flex, so I figured they'd be good at martial arts with flowy movements, archery, and yoga stuff, so I decided to take a cursory glance at Indian Martial Arts and bam

a lot of these comments are basically saying the guy has no idea what he's talking about and making wild misinterpretations, but I got no real frame of reference to know how accurate any of this is
Picture this: it's the bible, but all of the followers follow their favorite character and worship specific story arcs -- some have even made some fuck-ass fandoms. Occasionally some guy figures out that the gods we follow reflect us as people and begins to "transcend" the bible -- that's the Buddha.
ah there you are Mannie, I've been baiting you all day and you finally came....wait *ew*
Yep, hello. Just ping me if you need me --
Anyway, think of it this way: while the specific characters and story arcs are relevant, they're not the important part. The important part is more similar to Taoism, where one person recognizes the "story" and moves to "flow" with it -- and so you can begin to connect martial arts of the eastern philosophies and work "backwards" to get the general shape of Indian martial arts and forms (which is mostly various curved swords, a form of wrestling used as sports, poison, and a value on being a competent military leader).
The cool parts are probably the stories and how they relate metaphorically to IRL though -- and all the fucking _animals_ -- both in military and myth.
I'm no expert though, it makes no sense to me -- but it definitely makes some kind of sense.
What department of inspiration are you looking to get?
I kinda got side tracked and just wanted to listen to a bunch of stories and stuff from this, preferably from someone who doesn't have the entire video called incorrect in the comments, but it's youtube so I doubt that's possible
find some books or chronicles, then find some audio versions
as far as actual application of this stuff, I guess I want to look into like motifs, themes and aesthetics and such, to apply bits of it as a basis for these LONGBOIS, but not just..y'know...completely mimic every aspect of Indian life
If you have any ideas you'd like to see flourish, I'd be happy to lend some input -- just to see if it fits with anything I know or if I think it can be made to be esoteric enough in the particular Indian way
trying to look this stuff up is reminding me of the crazy ass Brahma puzzle from La Mulana 2
that was composed of all kinds of different parts and hints to get working all across the game. at one point you get an egg, I think it's even the Cosmic Egg, and you have to hold that up to a bunch of statues of creator gods from various religions all over the ruins, and when you do they release a colored cloud that you need to remember, because tablets will tell you what those colors represent by referencing the god. Which is important because each of these powers a colored light beam on the Brahma machine (yes it's a big ol machine) BUT THAT'S JUST ONE PART
there's these weird rings, 4 of them, you find in different spots of the ruins that have an icon in the middle, and a rotating ring, Copper, Iron, Gold, and Silver. Which as you might have guessed represent the Yugas. and those symbols in the middle, are a Lotus, the Vedas Texts, a Water Jug and Rosary Beads. you got to put a weight on a pedestal in front of each one, and whatever colored section of the ring *doesn't* make spikes come up and stab you is which yuga corresponds to which symbol
AFTER THAT you need to keep in mind some tablets that tell you what each yuga represents, and what order they go in
so once you got all that info and find the Brahma machine, you gotta point the right colored lights at the corresponding orb, while the correct face is showing, and when all four orbs are in place, it shows you a map of the whole ruins and indicates where any crystal skulls and mantras you are missing are at
that's why I love and hate La-Mulana
it also has a lot of fun dick moves where you go through all this shit to become the "Dark Lord" so you can go to this pyramid and launch yourself into SPACE to make contact with a space ship full of dead aliens that wanted to take over Earth and gave their tech to ancient civilizations, but fucked up and never got anywhere with it. and if you forget to put on this special armor, you just fucking suffocate and die because there's no air
That‚Äôs fucking cool
one puzzle that I feel pissed for not getting before is, in one place there are white pedestals, and you're told they can only be activated by something with the weight of a feather, tablets mentioning an actual feather that let's you double jump says it makes you weigh less, so I thought you couldn't do anything with them until you had the feather because if you put a weight on them you get zapped. I also thought getting Thor's hammer, which let's you absorb lightning would also help, but nope

Turns out you just....throw pepper on it, ordinary pepper you buy at the store on the surface. All it did was unlock a door to a place I had long since beaten
then there was the time I was an idiot and managed to not find the 2nd boss, brute forced a shit ton of the water based areas, and soft locked the game by tripping a flag that made the 3rd boss impossible to spawn
oh noooo @ soft-locking
All these Geralt memes are making me curious @a ghost with purpose have you seen the show?
Come let me whisper deep speech @timlives

how do bytecode
I figured out how some of the inventory works in RoR2
Using Mono and Cheat Engine
There's a big table, with every item in the game, for each character.
On pick-up, it just increases the item count for that ID
Theoretically possible to inject new items
Also the community apparently found a way to play as mobs???
@timlives you wanna do some dev or play l8r?
sure
okgool
I'm currently in the clubhouse, and I learned the BIOS are mostly unprotected :D

any of you still up
we've been able to translate the images text to this so far
To my old friend, imagine a number of men in chains, all under sentence of death, some of whom are each day butchered in the sight of others those remaining see their own condition in that of their fellows, and looking at each other with grief and despair await their turn. This is an image of the human condition. Nevertheless, my transmission is as follows:
Should you wish to old friend, I must first congratulate your encoding team for their ongoing hard work in making our operations successful. With that being said, Agent Ravern has informed me that a new shipment will be arriving sometime in the next few weeks. Depending on how far behind the Umbrella Corporation is to ascertaining our plans, the shipment will either be sent via plane or ship at this point. Nevertheless, our success is the will of Asher. My next transmission is as follows:

@Deleted User Where'd you find that?
One of the other guys was able to find it
the rest of it is solved somehow using pascals triangle

You guys know what you're doing -- but the last part doesn't seem to be Caesar, so it's safe-ish to assume (in this case) that it may be Vigenere's.
So a key is probably needed to decode it.
this some kinda Resident Evil ARG?
Chuck's ARMA group is doing a Cicada 3301-esque scavenger hunt
Yea we can't figure out the key to use for the cipher
tried all the personal info? names? mottos? callsigns?

and then the one dude got bit by one of the snakes and died
Holy shit
and westboro made a big stink saying they would picket his funeral
and it got national attention
Fuckin knew you guys would know lmao
I don't keep up with anything. A man could turn into a dragon, burn half the town down and fly off
"yeah that was the guy that owned that one store next to Wal-mart."
"who?"
of course that is literally the only interesting thing in middlesboro

false alarm team he wanted me to do pixelwork (;^; )

damn jarrr
i'm smitten by that frowg
i wanna--
oh fuck
jared @Demi Tarot
art thou busy
depends
dude
i wanna make a gaem
and i wanna make it
in 3d
and i need a brosephina to help me with a system
make a shmup
I'll design cute girls
no no no i need a game designer
somebody to help with the combat system
they will have sparse interactions
but cult fans will take these few lines and run with it
enemy spawning, map generation
3d art "generation" -- just our network of state system that interacts with possible states or whatever
how the hell am I gonna help with that. I don't have the attention span for programming anymore
no i just need a designer
not a developer
architect
but not the builder
i have some plans
like, enemy design spawn -- i wanna logically scale difficulty with environmental cues. like many mobs can clump together and work as a unit, or elites can share status buffs
and how some enemies are aware of more of their surroundings and use their own differences to interact (or not) with the world and creatures around them
then map generation and level design, that ties in with what these creatures (and the player can do)
that sounds less like a design thing and more AI stuff
system architecture, design, AI -- I don't design simply in the visual or multimedia/sensory sense
like a more abstract and still as creative version:
still way beyond my expertise
like, in order to make a interactables system, i would need objects -- and those objects can have base properties, like "can be broken, picked up, is_alive_oh_wow"
maybe, it's like designing a d&d campaign
but we are also making the rpg system
like, okay, so if i say "make" instead of "design" does that help? 'cuz maybe you don't "design" d&d campaigns but...
idk that's okay
it's almost like what you've already done with Hwunder
well
anyway, it's a big thing -- many pieces
so if you even want to just work on a single piece, let me know
I'm kinda failing at that too
and working on another new RPG idea, and it's clogged, wheels in the mud.
wellllll
kobe kobe'd himself
damn
what fucking timeline are we in? I just watched two completely different anime and both had a joke about how female hyenas have penises.

Guys Bannerlord Beta is here
so I rewatched that Emperor Text to Speech episode again because of course I did
>the Captain-General when they first showed up on the screen marching was reciting the tutorial speech from Dawn of War (again)
>the Binary subtitles during that autotune debate, translated the same words, but in 1337 speak
and when he says "fine" the binary translates to "never, I will have you assassinated"
thats great
@timlives ohhh seeeeeeath
@timlives juss comehurr

MYSTERY SOLVED, when I scrolled back through the stat blocks to see the Defender's Size I glanced at the Homonculus instead, that's why I assumed it was Tiny
@Demi Tarot absolute madlad

That is the most dedicated journalist I have ever seen
You have seen

All Gas no Brakes is the best interviewer
He went to Talladega
Flat Earther convention
Recently went to...AdultCon or something? Porn convention. Absolutely hilarious.
He's like Joe Goes but less cringey

Just make it a Quintet but that would make sense and Japanese naming conventions are incomprehensible anyway

You have a D&D sesh on the weekends right? @Demi Tarot Is it Sundays? Do you still work Saturdays?
I got a free month of Funimation from Discord Nitro which is üëå üëå  so you @Koala , and @timlives should let me know if you'd like to ***CONTINUE MUSHI-SHI***
I work Saturday this week apparently, because surprise shift changes whenever I have the glimmer of hope of getting anything done on time is painfully the norm
I do have a Sat and a Sun game ~~because I have a problem~~ though hr Sat game was on break because some players were on vacation
Ahh well that's okay. Just let us know if it feels like a possibility.
I'll be hope at fffffffffuckin 8:30 ish and probably fuckin die
just when I get used to this morning bs, they just spring a 2-8 on me
I thought it was kinda nice going home when the sun was still out y'know
also not having lunch during rush hour traffic
Why good morning @mannie.exe
How you lads doing
awful, going to bread now ( =A=)
üòî sorry @Demi Tarot night friend

Hey you! you up there! what are doing in *that* box alone
when you need to be in the other box
GET OVER HERE YOU SLUTS
Division 2 is also f2p for the next 4 days btw guys
so @timlives you could download it to try it out and see if youd actually like to play it with me
@timlives no wayyyy
***It's [REDACTED]!!!!***
from a recent patreon piece
@Demi Tarot I'd like to believe your second link was also from a Patreon post
that was twitter
That is why I'd like to believe it despite knowing better.
@Deleted User how may I hellpw ypu
@timlives
look at the account name and look at the license plate
For the first time in my life I think science has gone too far
Whoa when did Applejack get a fat cock?
AHAHAHAHA
@Demi Tarot @timlives ^^^
great even markov wants to watch mushi-shi
Markov generators aren't supposed to fucking make sense
bois
Nekopara is on Funimation now
@Demi Tarot tell that to nMarkov
this is scaring me
QUIT MOCKING ME
I gotta work 2-8 again, so I was FUCKING LIED TOO
is it supposed to be warmer or colder, I don't wanna go home in freezing rain in the dark
that's one of the many reasons I asked to leave by 6
WHOA
Did this Markov bot gain sentience?
but noooooooooooo 6 is when all hell breaks loose and only I can stop it because every other stock person quit so only I know where shit goes well enough to combat the swarms of people wanting booze
geez
no Markov, no D&D on the weekends, I'm busy forever
what activates him? he scares me
It's random.
is that the percent chance he appears?
Yes‚Äî after each message, there should now be a 3% chance Markov is triggered.
In fact, all of this meta-talk about Markov is going straight into its logs‚Äî
Oh, I can also force it like:
I swear.
I feel like I‚Äôm being mocked.
I read a screenshot LP of Final Fantasy X-2, and he complained that things were getting so samey in one dungeon he did an update where he just put the rest of his LP logs into a markov generator to make an update
NO
This vaguely feels normal.
I feel like it's watching us.
it kind of is
can we make it an anime girl though?
No, sadly. It's a closed-source bot by some entitled twat who thinks it's hot-shit.
And I didn't care enough to devalue his life and release my own version.
I'm sure I've seen other people with similar bots personalized for their server
Exactly. Generally people have updated a now defunct bot, or they have used a bigger bot that has Markov chain features.
This was the only single-feature bot that worked in present time.
wack
wack indeed
It really is self-aware now.
and it's a fucking LIAR
bump him to 5% so he's a critical hit
Maybe it's an oracle too‚Äî
Dude it knows you're gonna have a weekend campaign in the future x)
I'm telling you having anything on Saturday is impossible because I will always get cucked by alcoholics
I love how it tries to mention users and fails. It goes through the motions but stops short. A good thing, truly.
And you have a Sunday campaign though, right?
yeah
he's really insistent on that isn't he?
There‚Äôs only so much the guy is interested in‚Äî
For now.
I‚Äôm rewriting this bot later to allow training it with other data.
I wanna make a bit that I can say ‚Äúthis server‚Äù or ‚Äúthis channel‚Äù to and have it pull back all of the history it can and train forward in time with it.
Then I was extend it to other stupid shit, like cards from Cards Against Humanity.
Holy fuck. Markov chain Cards Against Humanity. That‚Äôs a million dollar idea.
I still don't remember what a bitchflip is
what
one of our custom cards was "the bitchflip" and I forgot the context
lmao oh okay
Do you still have the code for Treynreque? Was that what the deck was called?
it's probably still there. I forgot what the site was called
and all the jokes are probably outdated as fuck
card cast
That dated-ness will be a feature.
no need to get aggressive Markov
the code was RENRE
time to stroll down memory lane
memery lane
our jokes don't seem to go past Tyreal's shenanigans
wait no Telduria was after that, right?
if we do this again I dunno if I wanna make a new deck or build off of this
I remember most of these
"Not checking if a game has multiplayer before buying it for everyone."
Fuck.
Everything is still so good.
I almost forgot about circumnavigating the globe on a musical adventure
oh fuck
My eyes glanced past that because I didn't recognize it--
but now I doot dooloo doot doot.
that was a random magical moment I'm glad was chronicled in the cards
you and Michael just broke out instruments and walked around the planet playing into the night
yeahhh boiii
maaan starbound was a thing
too bad we fucking _died in a plane crash_
more like, I was having internet troubles and I come back to find you did ALL THE CONTENT
shut up Markov, you weren't there
but
whoa markie
chill
what
man
it updated a lot apparently
I haven't played it since but Michael has, and apparently it finally had all the quests and stuff.
I don't know what bosses there were even.
I don't remember the new ones.

@timlives JOIN ME
good news everyone that not permanent schedule I wasn't supposed to freak out over was in fact permanent s( '^')z
'^') trying to not be salty
^') but these chips are flavorless compared to me rn
oh
I've made peace with this outcome, but I'm still miffed I was lied too TWICE
Oh
I think I'm a bad influence on Mark
Michael thinks Markov just expressed your rage for you.
He's alive.
I've bitched about work so much the past two weeks even I'm sick of hearing about it
deja vu
What is this markov man bot
it's a Markov generator, which basically takes a database of words and algorithmically generates random sentences based on those words
so anything we say can and will be used out of context against us
So basically its a robot that mocks us?
Nice
Also @timlives I was convinced by a friend to watch Ishuzoku Reviewers and dear lord its worse than Monster Musume
It's literally hentai
It's not literally hentai, it's almost hentai
it is very hentai like eechi
sorry
it's *basically* hentai
*I Can't Believe It's Not Hentai!* the anime
exactly, see you can't air hentai on public television.
well they're not airing it on public television in Japan anymore, sooooooooooooo
I mean yeah look at it, the point being they almost got away with it
lmao
if it weren't for those meddling censors
@timlives bring death
Markov mocked me o.o
MOCK ME MORE SENPAI MARKOV
don't teach Mark to be a degenerate
today's been a rollercoaster
>start up in panic mode
>go to work feeling frazzled, but go about my business
>see some rules by the new co-owner, has an absurdly impossible time limit on how long you can be out getting food (it said 5-7 minutes, it takes like 2 minutes to get out of the parking lot sometimes and the closest restaurant is 5 minutes just to GET there, let alone order food and get back
>notice next week's schedule was actually posted in advance! I take a peek and I only work 2 days~
>riding high now
>co workers agree the time limit is wonk and basically say, to keep doing what I'm doing just don't leave when the co-owners are in.
>get paycheck and pay stub, THEY SPELLED MY LAST NAME WRONG
>have a good laugh and show my parents, tell them I'll get it fixed tomorrow
>"since when did you start making 9 dollars an hour instead of 7.50?"
>artist I liked noticed the fan art I did for them, so I get flooded with twitter notifications
Come child
@timlives bathe in the bath water of bathing
@timlives hu
hee
haa
Geeze Mark
so I can just slap m!trigger anywhere?
nah it's gotta be the start
I'm not allowed to do that
@Demi Tarot I laid the lowdown about the heist on Marsielle. She was speechless as she was suspended in time and Shehrat was just talking to himself. It wasn't very effect...
Everybody else will get a better, in-character low-down tomorrow.
CAT GIRLS GUYS THEYRE MAKING CA-
I'm concern.
@timlives ohhhhhhh
swear
wow
~~~~~
\~~~~~\
Fuuuuuturrrrrrreee
mmmpersimonsummonersprismshinesshimmersummonsanothersummonerpersimonmmm
there is always this sense that there is something that needs to be overcome, some unforeseen commodity that reshapes life
anyway hello @timlives
Same.
Also what.
oh
I love when he get excited about his job
hmmm i wonder what he says when I summon him
fuck
markov's getting lazy
Just like me
Damn mark
Not even a lil repentant
nice
yes markov
Really an anime girl @timlives
found it
update, the helicoptor thing was not a scam and was in fact referring to medical evac and was related to a health insurance thing dad had at his old job
@timlives happy you bi
look at mode
Goon starto
@timlives
Yes Markov.
It was always in the cards.
@timlives I gob glarined
Hnng
I'll get it when I can uwu
I've been playing the story mode, it's pretty damn good and all the girls are cute as fug
Oh no. Those were my only requirements. It's 1v1-only, right?
Well‚Äî for multiplayer.
yeah
but you can have lobbies
and take turns
Cool. Have you tried it? How long do the matches last?
Oh that's cool.
I've played the story mode
I think you got like 4 health, and like 5 lives? so matches aren't like super long, but not super fast, unless you are really bad at dodging?
I think as time goes on the arena gets smaller too making it harder to dodge
it's also pretty cheap,
hey @timlives you want a cute girl to shoot you right in the face?
Michael maybe unable. It sounds cool but idk if I can shell $13 for that rn. I hope Michael can though.
Seems it‚Äôd be fun for two people.
Are you uber busy rn? Michael and I had this talk about game development yesterday and I wanted to get your input on it.
I was gonna buy it, I think I owe you guys some gifts anyways
I don't count OJ because that wasn't a gift that was a curse
I got a game in like 30 minutes or so, but right now I'm clear
Okay gimme 5
I'm so glad he's feelin' himself
but that kinda pride ain't good for your health
My laptop is dying. @Demi Tarot Tell me when you think you can start on the sprites, and I'll put together some tasks for @timlives and us.
Did you have a document? If not, could you DM me some specifics? I'd like to make a kanban/Trello for this.
It'll be easier to things that way.
I didn't have anything formal yet
That's okay. Just drop me the basics in a DM and I'll figure out the rest.
Things like user flow experience (what the user has to get through to play), game over screen, pause screen, how many enemies there might be, how many states the character will go through before "game over," what the levels are like and if there are checkpoints.
Whenever you get the time you can expand on the specifics, but get me the basics for now to get started with.
wow accurate
I will fill this place with self-aware chat bots.
That is my mission.
Damn, anymore. Bring back the good ol days smdh
damn what anymore and stop shaking your dick hand/head
are you guys Markovs now?
Holy fuck. Markov chain features.
Hehehe
AHHH that's a good one
shit, michael got got by a bot
interested in what
tell me
hmm
it's like it's incoherent
yikes
shit jared
we're about to get bread
hell yes, I hope it's garlic
but we gotta teach markov what a bitchflip is first ü§£
@mannie.exe my internet was fucking me but its good now

@timlives yu
buh
called out
Universities all over Ohio are going to online courses after the state of emergency was declared yesterday
ohhh?
Yeah Miami just went online only
OSU did yesterday
I can't believe Markov planned the corona virus to watch anime
@Demi Tarot man has returned
@timlives hey (z|c|b|d|gr|schl)oomer
YO E3 is fuckin CANCELLED
hm I'm trying to have an appropriate response to the global spread of COVID-19 but it's not working right now lol
I can almost read future textbooks describing this era and it's only slightly maddening.
an appropriate response would be to worry just enough to take it seriously and follow the CDC guidelines, but not so much you get a compulsion to hoard toilet paper and masks.
Or come to small hospitals like mine and begin stealing supplies off the doors... which causes us to lock up our n-95 masks in our pyxis
Also our larger hospital in network is like send all your supplies to us therefore causing a ppe shortage which means we have to compensate by not putting proper precautions up lol
It's a mess..
jesus christ that's awful
yikes
coco is like the bigest shit poster on hololive
what did you just say to me
@timlives wanna go
No don't call out Jared he's young and free
At least young
Yikes. I'll die trying to talk to Markov.
Markov wants to play the killing game
ur my bro @Demi Tarot
i mean, michael says you're a microbe
okay markov sorry capitalism got you down too
sluts
and?
are you slut-shaming me? why would you do that?
are you a fucking meanie?
you know that means--
help me procrastinate @timlives
IMA DO U l8R
@timlives here's some cursed imagery
why would some one do that
@timlives are you ready
y
y
y
y
@Demi Tarot hey are you awake to wake the waking dreamer
hey Michael what would be some good cheap upgrades for your old PC? Like, if you still had it and wanted to upgrade it, what would you go for first? @timlives
Ok Markov will do
the actual video lol
this is the other one
@Deleted User The cheapest thing would probably be the graphics card. Get like a 1660 or something. Upgrading the CPU would require a motherboard upgrade, a new cooler and ram.
fuckin vegatal
THERE IS NO ROBOT TO GET INTO WHAT
I want to play Maiden and Spell but I'm scared of strangers so I don't wanna go to their discord
where'd jared go @timlives
oh what the fuck
hello jared
oh what the uck
that was automatic
hello michael
oh

uh
you guys wanna watch a cool video together
jarood is eating and Im video game
ahlright
I am no longer video game

"The Fog" seems like a fun fantasy expletive
HMMM
NOPE DOESN'T RING A **_BELL_**
I'm already here, asshole
Did you know: ‚Äúyou‚Äù is a recursive word?
In fact, ‚Äúyo(you)‚Äù and ‚Äúyo(yo(yo(you)))‚Äù are equivalents.
@timlives fuck you frank
So does markov just decide when to mock us randomly, or is he coded with trigger words?
we can either m!trigger him, or there's a percent chance he appears after every message
we have it as like a 1/20 chance atm
it's like getting a critical hit in D&D
only instead of more damage, you get a bot in the image of a russian man spouting a collection of words strung along by an algorithm
That‚Äôs the percentage Charles
yooooo just got furloughed from work
:dab:
I need President Daddy to send me my check pls

like if you think of a fish, a bug or a bird, like there's a generic model that fits into place, hell even for reptiles y'know. but there is no generic mammal ( '^')v
I think a generic mammal is a rat monkey creature
tbh I just picture like 7 different things
Rats, monkeys, tigers, dolphins, whales, bats.
strange monkey fella
@Demi Tarot we gotta pick a target mange

goddamn motherfuck drive- thru only takes those massive wave clumps of booze horders and bottlenecks them so it's a constant stream of running around like a jackass for hours on end jesus christ can't wait to do this tomorrow
damn employment
and my co-worker yesterday was sick, hoping it's just a typical stress related cold or some shit and not The Big Deal
if she ends up positive we're *fucked*
if that stimulus bill closes you could potentially leave work as marked self-isolation
MIGHT BE TOO LATE THOUGH HUH
ü§ß
still can't believe we qualify as life-sustaining
or that the people around here are actually patient enough to wait in a drive through line that coils all the way around the damn building
or that people would see a drive through line that wraps all the way around the damn building and an empty parking lot, and still pull up to see if we're open or not
Yay!

Sorry Andrew, bye Andrew
you're a player so I can't really divulge too much.

wow
why does he have an owo and vaporwave mode
WTF
***WTF***
because the person who made Markov is this a ~~cringey~~ nerd iirc
I don't think we're allowed to throw stones
okay he's a different, bigger kind of cringe
or maybe I'm just being judgmental based on what I know--
where's mikkle I found a stupid youtube thing for us to watch
~~He has like two major assignments due tomorrow and I'm uncertain of his last progress.~~
~~I think he'll be doing a lot of it today, or at least be upset that he hasn't done it yet.~~
ah
~~or maybe he'd have finished by the time he joins but hey who gnows~~
@mannie.exe I'd appreciate you not calling me out like this
I wish
Also I like how markov is struggling to use his imagination
the what now
You right.
hell yeah
THIS IS TRUE

" --because that wasn't a gift that was a random magical moment I'm glad was chronicled in the dark" that's some visual novel shit
I live for random, magical moments‚Äî chronicled in the dark.
I think he went from building a computer, to building a deck, to building itself. All in the span of one sentence.
what did I just witness jared
Wow Markie, pretty vain.
@timlives can you hear me?
I'm pretty sure I remember a cartoon character that looked just like that...
captain caveman?
cousin it?
I thought so at first‚Äî but I remember one with a similar helmet.
Very short. Like Cpt. Caveman but not him.
Damn.

Wait, shit, I lost it
okay bunman enjoy prison let me know if i can know to let you know the know you need to be let known

this is why I added Markov
~~so I could say shit like this and have an excuse~~
you're being a bad influnce
well i'm sure as hell not a great influence
i am definitely _an_ influence
Where did my capital letters go? Here we go.
okay michael was supposed to help us find a board game to play but he's pooping

you can set pages on that event to change it based on a switch
so, as you do a progress flag, you turn a switch on, and when the switch is flipped, the steppy tile changes to take you to the proper Kitchen Map
@Demi Tarot I'm dying
I'd like the clusterfuck to be delayed another week if possible.
discuss it to the council
i.e the other players
I rang the council bell
amen
@Demi Tarot @timlives hear that?
is it pointing at you when you say that, or are you not in the bro zone?
Hard to say, considering Markov is literally quoting me.
I'd like to imagine me saying "amen" just continued a conversation on Markov's side, and he was like "shid man"
"fug luv u guys ;'c"
we all know being a politician is like smoking weed-- a complete, packaged personality trait*

You might say that OS is

I need to rename Markov to Attention Bot

Michael watch that Crap Guide to Goblins and SEE how attacked we are
That hits a little too hard
and I know nothing about drawing sexy goblins *cough*
nice
I don't even consider myself DM'ing rn yet I still feel attacked
@timlives why are you up so early?
I thought you'd have classes at this time
Its almost three

Oh right
Well done

*COUGHS*
*spreads Germans across two aisles*
@timlives @Demi Tarot I asked my hosting provider to upgrade my Windows-- it was some enterprise, server edition that was incompatible with shit and I needed to give them my own license.
So no server but I backed up all I did. I guess Michael will have to run it for another day.
@timlives eyao
I need to find a better way to get anime, trying to download episode 2 of Kaguya Sama and it's literally just doing 0 bits
downloading steam games tops out at like 360 KB/s, but I can barely break double digits with this PoS
lol I got rid of everything I did yesterday.
We are on server-side plugins now. You can use whatever to connect to the server‚Äî no client-side mods needed.
If you're still using the instance, it might fail to connect to something in the beginning, but it will still work.
```
¬∑ click instance in MultiMC
¬∑ click "Edit Instance"
¬∑ click "Settings" menu item
¬∑ click "Custom Commands" tab
¬∑ uncheck or clear pre-launch command
```
^ this will get rid of the window at the beginning that fails to connect
@timlives cmither
He's not here yet
@timlives if you were a sword you'd be chunchunmaru
yo @mannie.exe i tried curry and naan bread for the first time today

the naan bread was fucking lit, but i wish the curry had more meat in it
hell yee
that's not very nice to Mr. Gator
do you have baby dick ass arms?
No I just like to be aware of disabilities without belittling disabled creatures.
that sounds like something someone with baby dick ass arms would say
Remnant from the ashes is 40% off my dudes

Also I definitely downloaded BETA 1.4.7 and just looked at it for a little bit.
Aite coo
I'll setup a server.
which version did I need for this?
says 1.15.1, you think being on .2 will break it?
No, probably won't break it.
I doubt it relies on any bugs that got fixed
lol
what
he's lonely
and misses micheal
that's ominous
what are you planning?
my headset doesn't wanna fucking sync
also @nMarkov
There's a resource pack in the file, do you wanna get it yourself with the map or should I just give you the pack?
let me see if it'll do a server prompt
Ahhh, right I can make it do that. I'll do that.
don't tell me the usb ports are dying or some dumb shit
there we go, finally
Gimme 10, I need to setup the server and mic as well.
I guess while I wait I'll just ask Markov what this jankass plan he's working on is
98.244.47.9

yeah
Sweet. I can finally become a billionaire by killing myself.
pretty much
nah you become a billionaire from killing other people
I will ditch America in a heartbeat to become a citizen of Alton Brown‚Äôs nation.
Fuck, I already did.
On the inside.

I'll be in that state when it's midnight for me too.
See you in three hours.
waow
@timlives didja win
mood
"what if it focused on building and maintaining a Tribe. So you can also accumulate NPCs that do stuff around your home camp, so while you're out adventuring you got some people running farms for food and materials, so the players, as champions, can deal with the exploring and monster fighting"
how does unknown energy sound for a production studio name?
p.s. unknown.energy is also a domain name
unknown but energetic

Cleaveland
Cleveland?
More like
C.leave.land

idk about michael but I'm making mods for RoR2 now
@Deleted User michael prolly won't be around for a few hours
do you wanna play a game or two?
I'm omw back guys
@timlives
so after like a month, my amoeboid brain finally realized why my co-workers name sounded familiar
IT WAS THE CHICK WHO CUCKED ROB
nice
it's time
to make
a clone
of risk of rain 2
I have garnered zero new information from learning to mod RoR2 but it feels nice to understand what's there. Though I'm not sure how all of this interacts.
You know how Diablo 3 has the dungeon generator? @timlives
RoR2 has something known as the "director"
I have no idea what it is to be honest, but the context has taken me far
wait I was wrong
the cucker girl was Jessica
Who're Patricia and McKenzie?
They sound familiar when I think of "Rob" and "cuck"
Patricia is his present gf, small and cute but psycho af
dunno a McKenzie
such is the price of small and cut
thought she got knocked up a while back, so is Rob raising the kid? did she get rid of it?
I mean Darren has a child too. Hell, my parents had a child too. Best of luck to the two of them lmao.
oof
mannie wanna play RoR?
yeah sure
Give me a minute to get some things together first
I'm setting up an AI that is able to take full songs and split them into individual tracks. I can't wait to slap some song elements I like together.
oooo
am i foreseeing a redbone remix in the future xD
no that sounds like something I'd see on the internet
if it's on the internet then why am I killing my brain cells making it??
@timlives [summon]
yo i think he ded
@timlives something cool just came
Is Markov being sarcastic?
sounds like it
@timlives let's play game

My drone is already in a tree and I‚Äôm getting a new one next week.

Ok ill hop in voice when I'm done dropping a shit
@timlives

that is very important
@timlives @Deleted User come on
take 2
Is it bad that sometimes I lie awake at night feeling like a bad friend because I invited Michael over one time for new years I think and I fell asleep and he sat outside in the cold waiting on me to let him in and then left because I didn't wake up until like an hour later.
Markov what the fucc
dude, Its alright. I have never been upset about that. I figured you and kim where just tired from working.
I know lol but it sucked because that was like one of the last times we were able to hang out before I moved
Ok Markov you do that chief
Why is our AI setting up another AI? Should we be concerned
at least you didn't like didn't fuck up lunch plans twice because
A) you didn't want to park your car in the rain (?) so you drove really slowly past the school without stopping or giving me a chance to even see if it was your car. And give up immediately
B) you overslept and told me you couldn't get out of bed because your dick was too big
did I mention that Rob was a grade a fugger
hahahaah fuck Rob
@timlives come on princess @Deleted User
@Koala have you thought about getting Risk of Rain 2?
It's like me asking if you've accepted Jesus into your life.
We've literally played together
The _second_ one?
Really?
Yes
*We have*
Stephan. The drugs are catching up man
Alright let's play!
@timlives remind Mannie please
Wait Michael was there too.
**MICHAEL WAS THERE TOO**
yeah
_I remember now_
we played with steven
WE HAVE A SQUAD?
SQUAD?
omg SQUAD?
I'm making dinner at the moment
OMG two soldiers a quartermaster and a chef?
Michael what the fuck is Mannie talking about
I got Charles the game earlier
And Jared too, but this game is OP and a little inefficient so he can't play.
So, now remembering that you have the game too, we have a SQUAD.
mannie likes squads
Yea I'm at work but I get off at like 11 tonight so I should be able to hop on if you guys are still up. Ik Michael usually dies at like 10pm my time.
Guys Darren has a kid.
Like, I forget that all the time. Then remember Darren evidently had sex with someone.
it seems unreal and horrifying until you realize that person is Ashton
Thats true
it's an edit, Markov
what the fuck stephan
I had a stroke reading that
I got my mask
hawt
true
true
true
@timlives
@timlives hello
@Deleted User why
Why not lmao
@timlives math me
@timlives
I would blush
I still think about that time we were in the book store in the mall and walked into the section that was nothing but 50 Shades of Gray and were like "how bad can it be" so we turned to a random page in the middle of the book and saw where it just said "Suck" and we closed it and just left lmfao @timlives
Its hard to take a book seriously if that is the first word you see
Bruva released Bro Trip 3 a.k.a Black Michael and Goth Stephan
@timlives my monitor is capped at 30hz because that's what the MacBook Pro HDMI port supports and mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cables are an expensive, out-of-stock commodities during a pandemic that originated from the world's manufacturing hub.

Yooooooo did you watch the LA car chase
Legit thought they were going to get away a few times
yeah I saw that
Saw a lot of crazy shit last night
Sacramento literally on fire
Riots and looting all over the country
I tuned in just in time for a broadcaster to get arrested in Atlanta
then watched 200 people get mass arrested on a Dallas highway
saw over 100 storefronts looted in rhode island
there was an apartment complex set on fire and a woman trapped on the top floor
and the firetrucks were all blocked by protestors
god damn it
Saw a guy harassing news reporters for "Selectively reporting looting during a peaceful protest"
then he walked a block down the road and saw 3+ shoe stores getting looted, an atm getting broken into, and a car on fire
He was like
"I guess there's some vandalism going on..."

O.o

It's really sweet. Just 10 episodes in thr first season.
Michael liked the first episode.
I picked the most atrocious, grotesque, and beautiful case for a new PC I have the pleasure of building.
It looks like its going to transform into a toaster oven. Or a slightly more normal-looking computer.
I hate how my brain is like
"swirling miasma of misery, I feel sick, having a hard time ignoring intrusive thoughts"
then out of nowhere just remembers
"you e?"
and I lose my shit
@timlives come on

He's turning into Andrew, but the corporate thinning of his time into unrelevant ventures is straining him.
i guess markov gets paid to grind bdo
one sec
@timlives come
@timlives is that a _**FUCKING**_  **bAnGeR** of a song there?
hey kid
i'm a compooter
stop all the @timlives ing
bond with me @timlives
i'd buy that
if I had a kitchen
@timlives
he dead
I FOUND THE MEDIEVAL SONG IN THE END
@timlives PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOOD AT rOr2
finally a real fucking president
@timlives
Nekrogoblikon is so damn good
oh right, someone at work tested positive so I had to go get tested after work
Nosefucking showed negative
that's good
it wasn't as bad as getting stabbed with a needle, but it was still annoying and my nose still kinda hurts
I have narrow sinuses I bet it's gonna suuuuuuck if I have to test
god how far does the swab go...
It goes way back there
^^^ thats how far its supposed to go
@mannie.exe
Holy fuck I'm uncomfortable looking at that
it feels like when you get one of those really bad sneezes that stings a little bit and won't come out
they called it "The Mindreader"
my nose still kind of hurts, but that could be actual allergies now
I tested negative, Markov, calm down
lmao
Markov like "yo this nibba gon fuckin die"
you're doing fine sweetie
Markov smite this man
Markov anti lobbyist confirmed
Also hes a baller
Its the bois
Where the fuck is the Michael?
Do you guys play tabletop simulator
?
sometimes
i was thinking about getting it
10 bucks for unlimited board games ain't too bad
I've played it with other friends, can be a pretty great time
this is stuck in my head now, so you dudes gotta hear it too
damn it sonuvadamnol dangit
Hello
Michael
My involuntary second half. How arrrre you doing today?
I am
jammin
Anyone down to play a 4 player survival horror game if i get it for em?
nvm apparently the game is EA abandonware
why does markov know my streetname
also apparently markov thinks Jared is doing you
he's shipping now, he's finally become human
time to put him down
How does it feel to know youve made life
I'm horrified and disgusted
like when you accidentally on purpose nut in the fat stripper for BAH
nice
Scientists all over are wondering if and when they'll achieve singularity and we've done it in a couple of months of shitposting with a discord bot
oh no, he's learned guilt
@mannie.exe @timlives
have i posted that before?
I don't think you have
oh i did back in june lol
you guys gotta stop picking on my markov
That's right. I'm trying to 100% the AI branch this playthrough.
@timlives gum here budder
@Deleted User what game did you wanna buy us?
GTFO?
Hemlo
HENLO
Now I've seen everything. Thanks Michael.
reminds me of Andrew's dad
@Demi Tarot I shiggy diggy
OOF
:thonking:
I'm pretty sure we uh, actually stopped fighting in Vietnam, not just pretended
@timlives
nice
it do be nice
it took me so fucking long to find the name of the song lmao
hell yea projekt melody
You clearly have a charisma score that oscillates between 6 and 12 on a monthly basis get it RIGHT
boi
That probably has bad temps
Hmmmmm CPU AiO is the only, single fan intake and two GPUs are stacked on top of each other...
*Probably* is being generously humble here.
:dumpsterfire:
bois im learning about WH40K
hot damn
So far Plague Marines are my favorite
Papa Nurgle bless
Someone in the comments described WH40K as "Imagine siding with the Nazi's because they're fighting C'thulu"
you got Locusts, Commies, Nazis, Elves, drugged up BDSM thots, 4 flavors of cthulu, angry terminator skeletons all out there slapping each other
I like Slaanesh because thot god
um does anybody here still play or has played Warzone?
alternatively, RoR2 or CS:GO would be funnnn
@timlives initiate boot sequence
Yarp I play Warzone
It a good BR
I'll be on in a bit to play some RoR
death stranding came out today on pc
:peepoShortOnAGoose:
Mmmm always wanted to be mindfucked by a walking sim
And by mindfucked I mean confused
what's so confusing about Norman Reedus walking across the US trying to fix the internet while using a baby to detect ghosts that are scared of his piss?
^^^
all of it
Everyone always hyped Kojima, but I'll be honest, I feel like he's not as good as everyone thinks
Either that, or DS is the perfect example of what you get when you put the highest expectations on one mans shoulders, and are inevitably let down
I mean, from the beginning a confusing artistic mess is what I expected
What does mannie have a bundle of?
you don't owe me anything Markov
He owes you for giving him life and sentience lol
WAT
god damn, he's reaching back to some random event from the first episode here in the season finale
This is only markys first episode bois
Oh god we're only in Markovs prologue
he only grows more powerful
When is the tournament arc
@timlives
That's a good one too
i got every DoW game for like $25 on g2a just now lol
so i spent 50 cents buying loot points for g2a
gets you 5 loot points
i opened one crate, and got a rare game that i wouldnt play
sold it for more loot points
got 256
Congratulations! You have discovered: **_black market video game gambling_**. Have fun!
yah yeet
just got goat sim
We all wish for simpler days man.
@mannie.exe you want borderlands 2 lmao
I have BL2
Unless you meant 3.
nah it dropped 2
Ahh, nah I'm good then. I got it.
We have enough games to play lol. At least I do.
lol
same
DoW 2 doesnt run in 1920 x 1080 üò¶
try harder
boi
idk what that even means xD
then you better try harder
it's easy
try harder
find GlaDoS
or a GL window resizer tool. I bet there's a mod for it too.
oh dude, I totally found a solution but it's mildly complicated
Not the same game though, right? Might have same engines underneath.
meh too many hoops to jump thru
doesnt bother me too much to play it in 1600x1200
is steam down?
i restarted steam and it was good
aight the intro cinematic for DoW 3 is fucking insane
my frieds I wish to ror
@timlives
cmere
@mannie.exe oi
you too CHUCK
Mitchell is dead but I'll üÖ±Ô∏èlay

Jurd does not have good enough compuder
ah

@Deleted User come play you bic
I'll kick ur coochie
@Demi Tarot have you ever done a commission of a portrait?
like doing a portrait of someone? I can do it. Dunno if I'd done it for pay before
Yeah, was thinking of getting something for Eastyn
like if I send you a photo of us could you do it in your style?
@mannie.exe F
@mannie.exe tell me not to get death stranding
Okay.
Get Death Stranding otherwise I will and give Family Sharing to you.
Because I almost bought it today.
Is it on sale?
no
then don't do it
you can't run it
It's a trap.
Don't play it.
YES.
Okay markof
I know you actually have a good pc now but no
I'M TRYING TO TALK TO ME THROUGH YOU MICHAEL.
Michael, make the game don't play it.
Make the wave don't ride it.
but the monster energy drink
but the fetus
it's too funky
It's not the Monster Fetus on the outside, it's the Funky Monster Fetus in the internal Norman Reedus that Guillermo Del Toro's black oil out of your soul.
That sentence feels like it was as hard to type as it was to read
yeah that one took a while
Bet
Just gotta have a _strong_ vision
now in like a month markov is going to start talking about fetuses out of nowhere
true
He's right
Yep
I'm so glad Markov is a thing.
Yesss, I remember Hellraid. Is there a release date yet?
lmao no
we get this
Ohhh, hm.
That's an interesting solution.
tbf the game basically turned into Dying Light/the dev team was moved over and Hellraid as a full game was cancelled
IIRC the issues were technical in nature
It doesn't seem like a bad move. It was the same studio and same engine in the first place. Maybe this is easier in some way.
it's probably more like "hey remember this game that we were working on and was cool and have all these leftover assets froms?
@timlives look at THIS
o.o
My immediate reaction was THE FUCK
the fuck indeed
my pp got yuuge
@timlives yer up errlay

Also dudes, Darktides release may coincide with the new 40k TV series about Inquisitor Eisenhorn
trying to design beep boops
holy shit
pretty cute beep-boop
the profile sword strike almost reminded me of a demiling because my brain is simple and smooth
well these are meant to be simplistic because mecha is hard and I don't have the patience
I've been flipping between those models and these designs
oooohh
my goal is a simplistic design, that has a modular feel to it, so I can make similar looking designs with different specialties
I like it
@the bbbbbbbBOYS come on
:jam:
I saw The Big Guy today at work

why did I get called out by a Chinese fast food reentrant
Why yes markov, i do receive pleasure when building, particularly in minecraft
Also michael i almost pinged you asking if that was named after you xD
wow
alright buddie
I just wonder what kinda google translate bullshit happen to get that
inb4 they were going for some Chinese mumbo along the lines of "Stoic Angel"
"Michael Alone"
Lmfao
but its is a McDonald rip off
that improperly color-coded picture of Sonic on that backpack had nothing to do with Obama either
clearly you have never seen obama
neither have you nerd
yeah I have he was on a backpack
china said so
are you a spy mister?
I miss Obama üò¶
also I google translated the chinese bit and it says mcdonalds
obama out üò©
you know
mcdonalds

He may have been a war criminal but gah damn did he do it with style

I gave up on ever trying to have any kind of discussion on current events with my parents when they thought Antifa was an honest to god organization
oh no

Good morning. Have you not slept?
No i fell asleep at like 11 or 12
Oh okay that's good
dude Fiddlesticks song is so good
Oh shit diddledicks is getting a rework?
He already did
and hes terrifying
**hell yeah**
his lore is on jah the creepiest in league
lemme give this song a listen doe
thats all his voice lines
the song is spook
oh it do be
But horror is my aesthetic
like i love all horror stuff
it's pretty lit
I'll find my spooky songs
his voice lines are even better
"They haven't come back from the fields yet... its been three daysssss"
oh I get it, they're ded
He mimics voices of what he hears because he can't actually speak
Ahohohoh
It just sucks that riot can make all this amazing artwork, lore, music, voice acting etc, but throw it all into an absolutely mediocre game.
üòÇ
Man, League of Legends when first released was a mild technological marvel. Things fall apart over time. üò¨
idk how it could even be imoroved, but people still "enjoy" it I think. I mean, you play.
Like, Fiddlesticks is just an "OK" champion. He's not strong, or weak, just like mediocre. But his lore makes him seem like an absolute badass and the epitome of fear incarnate. Like there's a petition to have him added to DBD as a Killer because he's so cool.
Indeed.
Also, me playing doesn't make me like it xD I don't think crack addicts like doing crack lmfao
ok fair
Thats literally all it is for me at this point. I got addicted to it somehow, and its hard to quit.
gotta big brain this shit
I guess its because I love the lore and such, and even like fanfiction that comes out for it. Idk why but Runeterra is such an interesting place to me.
Oh no, it totally is.
I'd say Riot is on par with like Blizzard and the guys that make Witcher in terms of creating worlds that suck you in.
Like, I've pushed myself through games for the setting. That's completely valid.
CDProjekt Red i think right?
That funny thing is, its not even hard to do Fiddlesticks voice lines. They're basically just whispered inhales like what Dani Filth from COF does.
They, like Blizzard with both WoW and Overwatch and all of CDP Red, know how to storytell, I guess. Like, I think why *some* people like LoL because, like you said, the lore gives the characters more life for your personality to connect with and affect how you play and feel the game, but, also like you said, some champions are just meehhh in how their lore feels against gameplay.
I mean, things don't have to be difficult or unique to be good and enjoyable.
Yep true. Like Garen, Lux, Cait etc are all basic champs with fairly basic lore, and that fits well into the game.
But then you have champs like A Sol, Cho, Fidd who don't really fit lore vs gameplay wise
Most champions have basic lore that fits their gameplay, but there are a select few that don't and sadly those are the ones that tend to have the most interesting lore.
God dammit Markov now im gonna have to vibe to redbone
CDPR does great work with great source material
D&D Redbone Remix incoming???
Oh that's true, both Cyberpunk and the Witcher existed prior to CDPR working on them.
They're video game adaptations of other mediums. Totally forgot. Almost makes it cooler imo...
You can work on this DYUCK
bro
vro
om.

markov has grown too powerful
I need to screencap that golden moment
Pinned a message.
Oh wait
i didnt realize that was markov xD
i thought mannie said that xD
this is how strong he is
he's reacting to memes on a human level
He's become sentient
I think markov officially passes the Turing test
This is it, now all that's left is to wait for him to grow powerful enough to destroy us
This man buying garlic bread
damn he is powerful
Horus is an absolute rat bastard guys
This man just described the plot of fucking Death Stranding
@Demi Tarot
wtf
oh no
markov is just slowly replacing me
Space Hulk Deathwing instead of ROR2 today guys?
I'd like to do a recorded playthrough of it for my YT channel as preparation for when Darktide comes out.
Also deadass, if we get a 4 man for Darktide, id like to record that with you guys
If everyone is cool with it
Deadass
Yee
I'm down. Don't make me look bad. I'm already pretty bad.
but before that
RoR2?
@Deleted User

went back to work on Saturday, and fuck me they wasted no time putting my ass to work 4 days this week >:c
that's good, did you test positive or no?

i too wonder whether to exact justice or chaos
that's a well-made animation
So is Markov something we made?
or is it a bot that you can download and add to other servers
no, and yes
we fed the garbage
but the garbage collector came pre-produced
have you guys seen this
Yeah
I'm mad
Ah ok Kim wanted one for her discord xD that one while just spat league of legends shitposts
I wanted to do it
will*
I've seen a bit of it
This thing's great, you can even have sex with it
at least thats what my friend told me
Fuuck
Even I am not that good of a DM.
Only Abed is.
can you send me a link for the bot?
@Deleted User thing is
It doesn't scan old messages
It'll take time to build it
Ah yea i get that
DM'd
Have you heard my soul lad Gus Dapperton? @a ghost with purpose
nay
Same
Thanks mannie :p

ok mannie to complete this music exchange can i link a song that i absolutely thought was gonna be awful but i ended up really liking
@mannie.exe
:worrypeek:
:aworryPeek:
YE
wow that gus dapperton song is a *vibe*
I needed that song, tyvm.
I wanna hear the original but I honestly just wanna cover the acoustic version. It'd be great on keys.
i disliked the original
gave the acoustic a try and love this version
Gus Dapperton is definitely a vibe. Wanna hear another?
definitely
Alright, weird and vibey or soft and loving?
soft
both artists have green hair
:thinkingpepe:
someone message me and see if i can hear the ping
because i cant hear discord noises for some reason when i join rooms
like the badoop noise it makes when someone joins or leaves
@Deleted User suh dude
oh shit
wait wtf
i can hear it in this discord
but not kims
I know I wanted to about game dev yesterday, I always wanna talk about game dev
huh
that song was lovely
think i like it a bit better than the first
oh dude I love "come out and play"
I'll check out the live
the song is already acoustic but the live version just hits different for me
this song is a BOP
btw
:jam:
:TriDance:
youve probably already heard this mannie
but its one of my favorites
That sounds a bit like Joji @a ghost with purpose
ya very similar sound

@timlives BOI
@the bbbbbbbBOYS GATHER THE BOIS. I HAVE MILKSHAKES
so I know some of you guys are MMO type nerds
do the higher tiers of equips from like raid/boss drops do much besides raw number increases? or do different sets usually confer unique bonuses
Don't tell me what to do
Usually unique bonuses.
Depends on the MMO but usually both
Depends on rarity, but there are usually set bonuses.
I only specifically know Archeage
And MMO, as Charles said.
I think I've only done high-tier content in WoW.
And Diablo.
But over a year later i can still tell you what every set piece from Howling Abyss does lmao
It's how it do.
What're we doing boy
I'm simping and about to get weed

the proc coefficient for the captain is dummy busted

u were right
im into it
You just had to admit it to yourself
Uh oh
üêõ
I get it
well boys
it looks like animemes might finally die
it's down 40k subs and only decreasing
traps win again
:ROWOW:
It's funny but also sad because I've been subbed for a long time
but hey if another good sub rises then that's good
internet moderators are funny people
they're the internet equivalent to an HOA
a Hard on Attack?
homeowners association
but they do have a hard on for petty bullshit
such as the word trap
animemes mods yea
but its likely just one or a few people
mad with power
it was a tongue in cheek reference to cross dressing or androgynous anime dudes
but then people started using it wrong for trans peeps
and now it's a dumpster fire
it's dumb but I get it
censorship is trash
yeah but in the context + intent and weebs it's the dumbest thing to censor it
also true
I don't think anyone's ever used trap maliciously as a slur
but people have seen the term and used it out of context as if it was a slur and it's dumb as hell
honestly most of the outrage of the community isn't at the ban of the word anymore, it's at the mods who are actively slandering the community and power tripping over it
reddit mods ruining a good sub whats new
:ResidentPatrick:
markovs been really amercanized huh
yup

i was wrong about medikit
they added a 5% max health heal in addition to the 20 base hp heal 1.1 seconds after taking damage
so they buffed the time from 2.0 to 1.1 and added a better heal
"Heal for 20 + 5% of maximum health (+5% of maximum health per stack) 1.1 seconds after getting hurt."

but the email didnt say what ToS i broke
so i have no idea what happened
did you use a gamer word?
Uh oh did you have a heated gamer moment?
nah
i was literally playing edf and in a call with mike michael and mannie
all of a sudden everything went quiet so i assumed everyone left
i quit my game after like 20 minutes and saw i was logged out
it said to check my email when i tried to log back in, and i had an email saying i violated tos and my account had been disabled permanently
Hmmm, any public servers you're part of?
It may be because of your name being publicly viewable on a public server listing. Which obviously violates ToS.
I hope you don't need me to explain why "YaoiHoleSupreme" may violate ToS.
possibly

have you ever gone through forums of people complaining about how hard something is just for motivation.
its a ritual i have for awakening some competitive energy inside of me like
look at all these losers on reddit that thought this was hard ill show them
( '^')9
Kind of. I think everybody who complains about something that I personally have no trouble doing is: just different enough from me. Eventually that stops being about sitting there with my dick in my hands, picking apart differences. It's just knowledge, technique, and then a practiced mindset, sure most people who don't already practice introspection, or whatever kind of healthy anxiety that allows you to progress is, will probably not do it by themselves-- but that's just a quality that changes. I have never needed competition to drive myself.

**_>ASCENDANT MARKOV_**
whoa
that's fair
I am active in said community but I also want no part of moderating the absolute retardation that is the general chat of that firearms server
understandable
I'm a janitor irl so I janitor everywhere I go, I can't help it
So I just go nowhere ahhhaahaa?
There's a verification process + role for actual gun owners and people able to follow basic instructions to actually get verified and access to the specific discussion channels and even that doesn't keep all of the idiocy out
yeah but that couldn't even keep the idiocy out in a perfect world though, people can be incogniscient seemingly spontaneously, and then stay that way or not.
everybody needs some garbage collection imo, to me -- in this context -- that doesn't mean being a mod because mods throw shit out generally
I like to idk recognize. Be cogniscient. Fail. Try again. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It's a public discord for a popular youtuber so you get all kinds of folks in the chats accessible to the unverifieds and the mod team literally closed down the meme channel because idiots don't know how to follow rules designed to keep the server from breaking discord TOS
I wish, Mark.
ohhh, so unverified spam and meme TOS fuckery are two mildly separate problems orrr?
aka, is the meme channel open to unverifieds?
Not so much spam but just general idiocy and degeneracy
Yeah it's open to them
I'm using spam liberally here. It's brain spam.
Because there needed to be an outlet for the memes else they'd spill into unrelated channels
I have never seen that work imo. Either the community learns how to use memes in the chat properly or they die.
But yeah that's a problem when you have... CONFLICTING PERSONALITIES.
Personally I have the general and other social channels muted and hidden because I'm just there for gun discussion and to learn. Which, as a verified member, is pretty good and generally on topic.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ask no questions and you will receive no lies, Markov

Cock and ball torture
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Cock and ball torture (CBT), penis torture or dick torture is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.

You're right Markov.
We all need to get closer together this season to solve our problems.
Right @timlives
what
Due to the poor design of the container that contains a type of air dried pork, known as salami, the lid of the container (which is crucial for keeping the salami safe and edible) will not rest in the established dimensions of the container, and would prevent the container from doing its job.  If these conditions persist, I fear the salami may be compromised.  To alert you to the urgency of this situation, I will repeat this message until a suitable solution is worked out and executed.
hes too good...
finally a podcast worth watching
Well that's definitely gonna get me in trouble at work if I listen in spotify

that whole album is a feature length movie
and is made by the guys that did the 3D parts of the Jojo openings
It's not quite feature length - only about 50 minutes long, but it's still really good and basically a giant acid trip
Although maybe that's feature length idk
feature is small boy times

dealing with China just seems like a colossal pain in the ass
when it comes to business
Such is life when all corporations are partly owned by the state
Which is why most corporations APAC offices were in HK and now Singapore
oopsie woopsie one of our employee's grandma had a chair that said "Made in Taiwan" so we had to ax the whole division so China wouldn't get mad
Ope someone posted on FB about the genocide against the Uighurs and now we're not allowed to do business in China
Like South Park said, you've got to lower your standards of freedom if you want to suckle on the fat teat of China
Markov confirmed for a Graphics Card
marky is a 3070
It's not even lowering the standards of freedom at this point, dumb-assery is baked into everything we do. Some people are aware of it and design a life with that in mind, and other people use the stupid to exploit and get away with shit and reeee-
China wouldn't be a problem if we didn't _already_ have low-standards of freedom over some of the regular old exploitation most states do.
Like most middle-eastern and southeast Asian countries thrive off human trafficking by suppressing sex worker rights, America respawned global war for oil -- "we" didn't "bring it back" but "we" definitely legitimized on a global stage, this time anyways, and now worker rights are under question again because pandemic and healthcare apparently both don't exist.
At least there is:
mac n' cheese.
I'm not quite sure I get your point but yes there is Mac n cheese and I enjoy it quite a bit
THERE IS NO POINT
thanks mark

So apparently Kiryu Coco and another Hololiver got suspended for 3 weeks after showing the Taiwan flag and mentioning it
I'm not even following anyone in HL I'm just getting it by proxy
suspended from what?
Hololive
oh
is hololive chinese?
i thought it was japanese?
aren't we all?
chinese that is, üôÇ
markov you will be assimilated you binary bitch
Markov don't play no shit
Hololive is Japanese and apparently lots of the Jp and EN fans are, understandably, quite mad about this
Its not everyday that a Japanese company actually gives a shit about the Chinese. I guess the fanbase actually posed enough of a threat to revenue that they thought it necessary to suspend a couple of their VTubers
hololive owns this one right
:yeah:
oof
Yes I think so
then they have my full support
ban them all
whatever it takes to keep this ship afloat
:NODDERS:
@timlives lmao get pinged loser
:a_PingSock:
this is the future
you'll know you've made it when you're forced to rescind political statements and formally apologize on your social media that you love china
im looking forward to it
PRC-chan is so dominant and aggressive I must say it's kind of attractive
:AwkwardFlushed:
Ngl I'm interested now just because its Kiryu Coco involved lol
Like, it's all so fucking dumb in context lol
CN viewers: use VPN to watch Hololive and set location to Taiwan to reduce lag

Gotta love corrupt communism under the guise of Democracy
<--- says the socialist. oof
its like this meme
but for china
lmfao
"LOVE CHINA"
"NO RIGHTS"
"ONLY LOVE"
üò°
yea china is like that markov
fuckin freaks
China went out with Marx xD
Where is the guise of democracy lol
There has never been any such thing in the PRC lol
yeah at least we're still pretending üò°
play along china üò°
China shifted towards democracy for a period of about 10-20 years. But it's seemed to regress in the past couple decades.
Ole winnie the pooh hates freedom
Wrong. China is greatest nation on earth
china numba 1
:NODDERS:
nimbus-chan is my kinda cloud girl
I don't recall ever learning about that shift, only that they shifted away from a central command economy towards a mixed market economy in the 90s with the reforms
Maybe that was what i was thinking of
Communism --> semi capitalism in the market sense, and not political sense
I imagine some people thought it would make the country more democratic but it really just centralized even more wealth in the hands of the CCP
Yea valid point. Short term boost to democracy, long term gain for the CCP
And turned it all into a massive, crony capitalist system under the iron hand of the party
Fueled by cheap labor and manufacturing. Short and medium term it's been good for them but in the long term it's going to prove unsustainable as other countries in APAC catch up in development and have even cheaper labor
Also all of the wealth, at least 5ish years ago, is concentrated along the coast and the urban/rural divide is ever expanding
True. Doesn't beijing house like nearly 30% of their entire countries population?
And china is by no means a small country in land area
Beijing does NOT have 300+ million people lol
why not
You're probably thinking just the coast
yea i think so
beijing isn't even the most populated city in china
:peepoNerd:
shanghai is the largest with like 24m
i sometimes forget how many people there are in china xD
theres a few
atleast 7
they have like a billion more people than the states
like actually a billion
like if it came down to a knife fight and it went man to man we'd have to take out 5 of them for every murican that fell
:monkaWW:
Thats why we all own guns :p
They have no deep water Navy and their air force can't compete. Conventional warfare would be a wash
They learned real quick though that biological warfare works though
Only their ground based missile systems would pose a threat to both our Navy and our air force
Not like we ever really have to worry about a war because the global economy keeps everything too dependent to do that
civil war is much more likely
:FeelsGladMan:
The worst you get is proxy wars between powers
Like Armenia vs Azerbaijan right now. Russia backs Armenia and Turkey has the Azeris
countries i've never heard of

smug anime girl @timlives
i just used my taco to push in the space bar on my keyboard to it would play my crunchyroll anime.

It's something alright
that is an advanced level of smug
@Koala met a girl on vrc that lives less than 20 min from me
:FeelsGladMan:
i think she wants to pog
:WidePepehappy:
Pog away my son
DO IT
She in Middletown or something?
COOM
...is she 18?
Very important questions here lol
she lives near KI
and shes 25
:poggers:
its quite epic
Go forth my son and acquire VRC gf
ok for reference stephan i dont think ive talked to a stranger irl in over a year :OMEGALUL:
I get the feeling
AND SHUT UP MARKOV WE'RE TALKING IMPORTANT SHIT HERE
markov :GunLeft:
we'll see, ill keep you updated on the pogging status
So help me Andrew I will fly back to Cinci to yeet your ass out of your house if that's what it will take
LMAO
Yeah that's right Mark stfu
don't be rude to my boy
This is important shit Jared
no excuse for rudeness
You're right, sorry Markov
if you can't treat a machine with respect, how can we trust you with ladies ( 'A')9
I've been with Eastyn like four times as long as Markov has been around
:peepoShrug:
i'm definitely in a get-my-shit-together mood before i wanna date anyone tho
:FeelsGladMan:
guess i should get to it
Some extra motivation can't hurt
that's a mood
I always get conflicted when I'm motivated by girls because i was kind of like that in high school, and I feel like I'm using them as a crutch and not learning to do things for my own sake
Nothing wrong with having a girl be a reason to improve yourself, just don't let it be the sole reason to do anything and everything.
better than not being motivated at all I guess, but as all fleeting things it would of course be better to make fundamental changes
hope you're doing too, Markov
I will say that I stumbled ass backwards into my relationship so take my advice with a grain of salt on how to get started dating, but managing to stay together for 4.5 years takes a lot of work
yeah good job with that btw
:HappyFroggo:
I am impressed and happy for you
And I will say that being with Eastyn has been the biggest confidence booster I've ever had in my life
:PepeKing:
LMAO
MARKOV
I take back my apology
actually roasted
:fiteme:
my brain feels BROKE because I genuinely feel no incentive to pursue money or romance which is why ive been basically wasting away for the better part of the year doing nothing
the bosses are DEPRESSION and ANXIETY markov pay attention
I just remembered back to when Eastyn and I ran into your dad at a Wendy's outside Louisville
I was feeling that super hard, too, but then I woke up and realized I had a crush on one of my artist friends and was like "holy shit I'm actually not happy wasting away and being a non-entity"
that's sweet and encouraging. I get that, it feels like its been ages since i cared about impressing anyone
that random rush of passion was scary but invigorating, had to kind of dial it back because she had her eyes on someone and I didn't want to interfere, but it did spur me to try and be closer friends with them
I remember that too Stephan my dad wouldnt shut up about it for weeks
Lmao really?
yep
That's kinda hilarious but I hope it wasn't in a way that he was trying to get you to start dating again
It's hilarious in a cringe parenty way. Wasn't anything bad or unexpected
Hahaha
my dad is constantly trying to get me to date and work again
Well I suppose I'd be worried if he wasn't lol
bleh, its just the way he does it and the consistency-- i havent had an actual conversation with him in a long time because im too busy dodging the endless loop of
"x place is hiring you should apply"
"hey you gonna sign up for some classes"
"i saw <literally any female at any point since we last talked>"
I imagine it's quite tiresome.
yeah idk the last like 3 years have been really stagnant for me but im still trying to find something I wanna do with myself that actually makes me wanna get out of bed in the morning you know
At the same time, I know it comes from a place of caring on his part. He's not exactly a great communicator though, and that doesn't help.
yeah it comes from a good place, just executed very very poorly
Do you feel like you've made any progress on that front?
The figuring out what to do front
^
Markov coming in hot
im hoping I can make something happen in vrc i just need to *start*
I have a pretty good feeling about it though
Feelings are a start. Writing things down makes it more real.
i make a lot of notes actually of things that i feel
so i dont forget them
heres one
"horny jail map pog"
:NODDERS:
:Okge:
So it sounds like you have something of a plan lol
But is it a *plan*?
Or is it a mess of written down feelings?
Oh I have a plan
:HappyCool:
Is it something you can put dates to?
I could but I'm hesitant to
What makes you feel hesitant about it?
What makes you feel hesitant about it?
What makes you feel hesitant about it?
my current goal is to fix my sleep schedule so I'm awake at the right time of day for the routine I want
but ive been just sleeping at noon for a month
:pepeLaugh:
What kind of schedule do you want?
i wanna sleep 4am-noon so i can adventure (and future stream) during the day then hang out in my favorite streams at night
rn my alarm is literally set for when my favorite stream goes live its the only reason i wake up
actually pathetic
:OMEGALUL:
What's your current sleep schedule like?
11am-7pm
11am-7pm
i am currently trying to reset it
:Okge:
So literally opposite of what your goal is :WhatChamp:
Lmao
i am currently trying to reset it
thats why im still awake
also that girl
:monkaHmm:
Aha
ok maybe theres something
to this girl thing
So you're trying to reset your sleep schedule today
That's good
if i can get to a point where im excited to stream everyday even if its just for 4hrs that'd be epic
im pretty sure id auto win from that point
What do you think would help you feel excited to stream?
having fun üôÇ
I think that part would be pretty easy honestly
this schedule issue is actually the hardest part
What do you feel is the most fun parts of streaming?
having interesting conversations
and clout
Yeah having clout can be pretty fun lol
And I imagine there hardly a dull conversation in VRC
yeah, like I said I have a good feeling about this
also I think when i get vr + full body for vrc I'll have a ton of fun doing shit
like dancing
and degen shit
Oh yeah, I'm just trying to put that feeling into words for my own understanding and potentially your own benefit lol
I appreciate it
Always. Like I told you years ago, if theres anyone I know who can do it, its you
its helpful from the sense of working through some anxieties i really shouldn't have
:FeelsStrongMan:
thanks man
:SMILERS:
ok i missed a lot
did he decide to coom in her?
Chuck I swear to god I will toss you into lake Michigan
yeah i think im gonna pog but before a man can pog he must first invent the universe
:NODDERS:
Honestly, just meet her to get a coffee or lunch or something. If you're actually interested in her i mean
If you're still awake I'll hop on to talk some more once I'm home from work, Andrew
Question about girl: how long have you been talking to her?
we've talked briefly the past few weeks then today we figured out we lived nearby and she was giga interested in chatting more so we talked a lot
but tbh I don't really care about that as much rn. It's a cute thought but far away from my mind cause I wanna get my shit together first
something to look forward to
kinda thing
:xqcK:
That's cool
:HUGERS:
:FeelsGladMan: its a nice thing when someone wants to talk to you, learn more about you, laugh at your jokes
sugoi
:FeelsGladMan:
:GunUp:
ok dude
LMAO MARKOV
HE DON'T MISS
HE DONT
mans about to call in his killstreak
attack helicopter
IT AINT BASED
Hes just walking around the map with Juggernaut armor on man
oh there is something productive ive been doing
im tryina get in shape
:peepoStrong:
Pog
I'm back on my calorie counting
no joke i found this avatar in vrc
and i was like
damn
i want some fuckin ABs
so yeah fixing diet big time and been excercising
I gotta start going back to the gym
I had *just* renewed my gym membership in Wichita before COVID struck
oof
I think it would help my confidence a lot to be able to flex on people like, "yeah you're funnier than me, richer than me, get more puss than me, shag more moms than me, but at least i got a 6 pack"
:peepoStrong:
I was so pissed lol
that sucks
:peepoRage:
:peepoDetective:
oh i also wanna do work out streams in vrc they seem like easy content
but i need to be in some kind of shape
so i can actually move my body for more than 30 min without dying
:pepeLaugh:
It's hard to add working out into your schedule when you already spend 9 hours at the office most days
yeah ive been doing a lot of nothing and work outs have been easy way to feel 'productive'
plus you know i basically have a home gym
And when you're a lazy fuck like me once I plant my ass at my desk at home I ain't gonna leave lol
So dieting is my best choice
dieting is op
Andrew I want you to know that because of you I have been having weird dreams about VRC
am I in them
*naked* ?
Which really is easy when you're just counting calories using Myfitnesspal like - this is taking a turn
oiiii the michael is here
Yare yare daze
why not get into walking stephan? like just walking fitness trails and such
Gotta fit it into my day
only 3 types of cardio I like are cycling, swimming, dancing
deadass, one of the guys from work started walking like 1-2 miles a day, and cut soda out of his diet, and lost like 80 pounds in 6 months
everything else makes me wanna die
oh shadow boxing is pretty pog
Now that the weather in Texas is no longer like living on the surface of the *fucking Sun*, I'm going to start going to the park near my apartment
its already cold here :c
I think, so like over the last couple weeks I remeber three:
1. I got cucked by mudercrumpet
2. I meet mudercrumpet and fan girl screamed so loud and high pitched that it woke me up
3. The one I had last night were I was a bunch of us and ladle and her friends drinking and having fun.
High of 80¬∞ today in Arlington
like it went from 80 yesterday to 50 something today
It was literally over 100¬∞ every day since I moved in til labor day, then it was in the 90s til a week ago
But like I said, it's hard to fit it into my routine, because I like to eat dinner early so I can veg for the rest of the evening
routines are hard YEP
And habits are hard to break
this
mother fucker
alright
ALRIGHT
Markov I can't deal with this many friends being out of whack at once okay
Take a ticket and get in queue
what do you MEAN
HES JUST KILLING ME
IM ALREADY DEAD
We have a depressed roaster bot now
I bought a fit bit tho a while back
Now I get to worry myself about my heart rate all the time
that sounds stressful but also motivating
These markov takes are genuinely making me laugh, which is kinda rare
I find a lot of things funny, mind, I just don‚Äôt emote
Nothing has topped the quote I pinned though
I fear the day that quote ever gets toppled
Oh trust me I'm already paranoid about my health when I'm only 23
On the subject of growth I think I figured out one of the obstacles I‚Äôve had when it comes to making RPGs
I usually go in centered on a mechanic and try to slap together character concepts to fit it, but they feel like concepts so I feel no investment
Do you think there's something different you can do?
@Demi Tarot?
Think of a story and get invested then add mechanics
mandrew
come play
I did like working with Andrew on his thing because I had investment in the characters an plot
Jarad have you though about making a seinfield-esq rpg. Where its just a bunch of almost meaningless quest with no point, but at the end of the game all of your action come back to haunt you.
And then there a dumb jazz riff at the end of every quest
Sounds almost LiSA-esque
volume warning

@ChuckRadaman why'd u go

@Koala
watch political debates with memes live in twitch chat
its epic
Biden told Trump to shut up and it's all I ever asked for
xqc's chat is just treating it like another among us game
Orange sabotaged healthcare :WeirdChamp:
god i love american politics
this is amazin
this is the most entertaining thing I've ever seen
i had a stroke about 20 seconds in, couldnt handle it
:PainsChamp:

They cut Trump's mic

tfw the president gets muted :OMEGALUL:
500,000 charging stations
:sillychamp:
oh biden
Pinned a message.
man, america is so fucked
im kinda hoping i do get to move to canada
Gotta love how Trump gets asked to denounce white supremacists and instead gives them a call to arms
"Say they're bad" "Yo homies its time ya'll square up"
The phrasing he used, is literally what we used in the military when we were awaiting deployment orders, or orders to mobilize.
He knows exactly what he said
Oh yeah it's exactly what it means
Yup
America is hitting its boiling point
Also love that he basically told his supporters to go commit voter intimidation
Even if Biden wins, there will be rioting
We've learned 3 things. Trump is actively prepping America to become a dictatorship on par with Russia. He will use white supremacists and neo nazis as his own personal army. And there will be a white supremacist uprising in the case that he loses to Biden. Fuck me man.
Damn this ammo shortage
this is america
:YEPW:
I literally told one of my friends from the UK if he wanted to know the state of America, he should just watch This Is America
@timlives
@ChuckRadaman yo you wanna watch re:zero
oh yeah you guys are all caught up now right?
I haven't seen todays
me either
great we can watch it together
side note, I like how we've been looping the same few days since like episode 2 of this season, but it's still managing to escalate and stay wild
I know right, half a season and subaru is still on the same like 3-4 days
YEE
I think Hamtaro was probably one of the first anime I've ever seen. When I was a kid and didn't know it was anime
I think it was on Cartoon Network or Nick or something
Me: I want a Pickle Rick crack pipe
Mom: We got a Pickle Rick crack pipe at home
Pickle Rick crack pipe at home:
dog came back as soon as I walked outside
I am pro dog finder
nice
nevermind the time I thought the dog snuck out and ran off because she was sleeping under a house and I thought she somehow escaped her enclosure without breaking anything despite being drugged up and massive
in my defense I called multiple times right outside of where she was but she never showed up
bitch.

:doot:
markov...
Markov is ready to play Phasmophobia
what kind of halloween is this guy having
a bangin one
Phasmophobia would probably be less scary for Chuck and I if we had Spooky Scary Skeletons on repeat
one of these songs is not like the others
Can we get a working music bot again
Because if I was listening to Ghostbusters then I could probably actually step inside the damn houses
BUSTIN BUSTIN BUSTIN BUSTIN BUSTIN
we're doing amateur difficulty maps built for 1 player as a group of 4 and stephan can't leave the van
BUSTIN MAKES ME FEEL GOOD
*dies to Banshee*
:pepeLaughing:
I am
As Chuck said
"Bitchmade"
Jfc these are 1 player maps?
yeah they are small houses
What the fuck
theres a highschool map thats 10x bigger and an asylum map thats 15x bigger
:YEPW:
Oh **fuck no**
I am ***not*** stepping into a fucking ***asylum***
the dev is making a mansion and a prison map too
:ComfyBlushTeal:
**I'M**
Markov can be our 5th
@mannie.exe can we get a music bot again
@Demi Tarot is Minecraft Steve literally the new character
yes
and has alt skins of Alex a Zombie and an Enderman
they look and move exactly like in Minecraft and it looks weird and creepy as fuck next to everyone else
I'm not super sure how his moves work since they said they'd explain more in another stream on the 3rd
but he obviously puts down blocks, and has the glider, looks like he can upgrade his sword in combat
and his final smash summons a giant piston that if it hits someone, knocks them into a fortress filled with TNT and creepers and blows up
also this
Okay now it's worth
I just love how Sakurai explained how this all happened
Please share
apparently Nintendo execs badgered him about it because it was the best selling game worldwide, so he *has* to be able to do it
to paraphrase Sakurai "Nintendo approaches me with ideas, and if I can't find a way to properly honor the spirit of the character I refuse. I was like 'do you know what kind of game minecraft is?' we'd have to rework every existing stage to make sure blocks work, and the wizardry it would take to make all this work is flat out impossible....so  I said 'Sure I'll do it' "
That's bonkers yet very much on brand
:OMEGALUL:
this tweet thread is a goldmine
Agh agh agh agh

@timlives what rum do you usually get?
Cruzan is good basic white rum
@ChuckRadaman
I like Captain Morgan spiced rum
That and their coconut rum
@a ghost with purpose
I usually get cruzan cherry
But Michael said he had some spiced that was pretty good he could drink it straight
Still gonna mix it with coke but
Shake it up a bit
Mix it with Dr Pepper if you like it. Its got a better kick than with coke
Spiced rum mixes well with the spiced cherry of dr p
Yeah cherry rum with cherry dp was poggers as the kids say
@Demi Tarot The one I got that I could drink straight was captain morgen 100 proof spiced rum
but for mixing I like the captain morgen black spiced
I like Appleton Estate for dark rum and Cruzan for white rum
I typically mix with lime and coke for a cuba libre

Love is War season 3 yay
Sorry @timlives i fell asleep xD
The air is thick and heavy, the darkness too is impenetrable. Regardless, you are sure that you are not alone in the cavern. There's a sound of shifting earth. Straining your eyes to see deeper into the rocky chamber, you call out: "Who-- who's there?"

There's no sound apart from the waning echo of your words. As they ring out throughout the walls, you think that you must be becoming mad. Is this all just in your head? There's another sound, almost a thud that accompanied a slight tremor. You squint again; you can't see anything beyond the pitch black. "Show yourself!" you shout out, a chill running along the back of your neck.

This time, a vague shape appears from the darkness. It's faint, but you can make out the golden hue of a coat of fur. It is massive, imposing, and the chill grows as you realise what you are facing. It does not seem to be approaching you, rather, the darkness retreats to reveal the form of the being before you. A Gregorian chorus begins to drill into your head, faintly at first, but quickly growing in volume. Your shaky hand hovers over the hilt of your sheathed sword, as the being becomes ever clearer.

You can't take it any more, and you cry out, "What are you?!"

The chorus goes quiet. The being bears its eyes upon you, and it speaks.

"The goodest boy."

Hunt: Showdown
Charles got it, but he's uncertain if we'll play it.
its more fun with like 3 people, solo can be fun if youre into the more spooky aspects of it
wait, i thought this was just a sfm video
but its actually a game
I would buy it, Chuck, but idk when I would play it lol
I juggle multiple games and friends groups ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Cuz it's up my alley but there's only so many hours
my mom asked me if she can drive to other voting locations to vote multiple times for trump
Uh
because "biden is cheating" so trump supporters need to make it right
:NODDERS:
FOUR MORE YEARS
I did not take your mom for a Trump supporter
:WhatChamp:
I asked why she was so passionate about trump cause shes always voted republican but not been very passionate
she said it was because of the stimulus checks
check
trump sent her money :NODDERS:
I mean, that's kinda understandable
Even though it's more of an advanced tax refund than free money but uh
"Biden is cheating" is :Thonk:
This election really got people wilin
she heard it on a facebook video
she was raving
:OMEGALULU:
That's what I assumed
Facebook is cancer
:PES_PoggerBurger:
this election is prime entertainment

That's one way to put it lol

trump is actually gonna lose the popular vote but win the election *again*
god bless america
oh shit michigan swung blue
winnable
:PauseChamp:
It's really all on Michigan and Pennsylvania
Biden will most deff win, unless Trump is somehow able to have all the early voting ballots thrown out like he wants
Hes whining about the sudden dumps of absentee ballots now
Who knows, maybe he'll kill over after the news that he's lost, and I'll never have to hear his name again.
Hahahahaha that funny
Well Chuck you're in Wisconsin how does it feel to have your vote matter
Wisconsin looks pretty gg to me
michigan could flip again but if it stays blue with nevada thats lethal
gg ez
As long as Michigan stays course and Biden wins NV that's all he needs, PA or no
ye pa doesnt matter
Kinda hoping PA flips to blue tho
well biden needed pa or michigan or georgia to go blue
with nevada and wisc
This is too close for comfort lol
there will be uproar either way
Im still cursed by that reaction post of the guy leaning back because Rob and I saw a specific one in a screenshot of a 4chan post and could never find it again
:worry:
dude
I wonder if I can convince Biden to say Pog
Like "Oh we won America, and that's totally poggers"
My fellow Americans we cock dick ballin, poggers
YEE YEE
i cant wait for biden to have a shit presidency that leads into a true shithole afterwards

Stephans mom on dec 10th
Uggggh Michael get me out of this hoooouse
I was nagging about being burned out with this job and could make more money from art, but mom deflected it to Dad probably losing his job if Biden wins because they‚Äôre gonna kill coal again
I'm trying, finding a job is hard
She acts like i will instantly die if I don‚Äôt have this part time minimum wage job
Coal is dying no matter what so idk
markov no
michael ded
he ded and biden kill him
he is kill
Markov is going to abduct Mikl
The point is more money less stress on the titty route but mom refuses to see it as viable because its not staaable
imagine basing your entire livelihood around a non renewable resource
O O F
The only reason I‚Äôm not making more money now is this job draining my will to live
i feel that
No part time bank jobs around here either because dead town
I applied to a place in harrogate so hopefully they atleast contact me
Fingers crossed ü§û
I can't believe we Michigan'd
I don't trust Nevada
I KNOOOW
:c
AP has called Wisconsin for Biden
I wonder if that's enough.
Michigan was also turning blue we said? It's like Illinois and Minnesota are spreading towards Ohio. Slowly.
:peepoShortOnAGoose:
me omw to riot
Don't forget the gas mask.
Ohio is turning more red, Texas turning more purple
nevada's more likely to fall thru than michigan at this point
if nevada falls then the only hope is Pennsylvania having a *lot* of mail in ballots :pepeLaughers:
This is stressful.
Tbf they did have a *lot*
how many? as many as the dems need :pepeLaughers:
:pepeLaughers: rigged
@mannie.exe im listening to this its pretty relaxing
Oh yeah I know this
So last night there were like, 2 *million* uncounted absentee ballot and a lot of Philadelphia votes not reported in yet
Mmm blue moon
Bidens vote deficit in PA is ~500k
ye it could flip
They're gonna need a 2:1 ratio in those absentees
More or less
there will actually be hell to pay if PA flips blue
i swear orange man will call for people to riot
yup
No ones going home Markov

Apparently the counting center in Arizona has closed to the public and media, because armed Trump supporters have gathered outside to intimidate the counters.
:monkaS:
They're literally just unapologetic fascists at this point.
I fear for the sheriffs in charge of containing the crowd of armed angry trump supporters
spooky job
armed protesters? man it sure sucks the cops used all their tear gas and rubber bullets on unarmed civilians.
I'm gonna say the sheriff is probably uh, sympathetic to that mob
their job is to prevent the mob from overrunning the building tho
:monkaS:
Lmao
so
i bit the bullet
and bought this
Okay
I'm not sure if that's a decent price for a rig that's three years out of date but it'll play games well
Well I was able to finance it for like 100 a month
Because I cant buy a PC outright, and i dont wanna wait 6 months buying parts individually
looks good chuck-chan :AYAYA:
Imma give kim this PC in the meantime to hold her over, and once the new one is paid off, ill get her a new one.
Alrighty, that's a good deal then, nice
I hope you're not paying interest on it lol
its like 120 of interest total
but if i pay it off like a month early then basically interest free
me when i ordered my pc, and kim walking in as soon as i hit accept.
*erased from existence*
Markov don't worry buddy I'm coming to get ya
Damn Michael. Looking very fluffy today.
Thanks

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Trump to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well in Georgia???? This is so fucked.
LOL
LETS GO GEORGIA

Ayyyyyy
I
LOL
Markov is sending you on a fucking quest
you know what you must do
ü¶Ä TRUMP IS GONE
ok buddy hasan
Millions of Americans are breathing easier tonight that more of their rights won't be stripped away. Millions more are clutching their guns and crying in their bathtubs because they think big bad Bidens gonna take them and tax em to death despite making 30k a year. Bless America bygawd.
Guns folks I talk to are more concerned by Bidens gun control ideas. Expensive tax stamps for basically everything.
Not likely to happen at all, but its basically the one major thing I disagree with on the Dem side of things
I balk at the idea that our country is in a better position. Same circus different clown.
I usually see these things as a Rich vs. Poor kinda deal than Blue vs. Red
but its nice to have someone that isn't openly xenophobic and constantly bitching and whining on social media as the face of the country
:OMEGALUL:
the replies
pffffff
I'm just glad we have someone who will actually act like a statesman and not a child
which once the white supremacists have been poked back into the sewers like they belong
means we don't have to deal with this reality tv drama bullshit every week
Not like Trump is going to go quietly into the twilight. He'll bitch and moan and whine on very public platform he has and he's ingrained his brand of bullshit into the GOP
So don't be surprised if the reaction in four years gets us Trump again or another MAGA-type
he's losing his twitter protection and is probably gonna get banned for breaches of ToS
and hopefully arrested for tax fraud and all the other bullshit
It'll be interesting to see what the New York AG does when he loses his executive immunity
But again, it won't be quiet. Even if he himself gets banned from twitter he's still got millions of rabid followers and a fair amount of the GOP on his side in Congress to continue to spread MAGA bullshit
if there's any upswing to that, maaaaaybe that'll keep coal companies fine for another few years so my dad is okay and I don't have to worry about not being able to afford medicine while I'm stuck here, and such
It was so god damn horrifying how after that dad went from not really caring about politics to just...doing nothing but being glued to fox news and buying in to every "dems are communists" arguments, to trying to excuse the xenophobia and shit
populism is a powerful drug
the thing I hate with most of this is the Us vs. Them mentality where people are so quick to demonize anyone on the "other" side and justify "Their" side that they can't take a step back and properly criticize things
like, I tried to pick apart my issues with it from an economic standpoint as a BUSINESS MAJOR, and I was told I don't know how shit works
"so you admit you wasted thousands of dollars putting me through college?"
oh oh oh and accusations of me being brainwashed on social media (which I barely interact with) because..I had empathy for other people???
and then when you can actually stump them or bring up something that breaks through the facade, you just get the "you young people" bullshit
because it's never a discussion, it's a fight, really.
like the whole shit with my dad giving me shit for my political views ONLY got brought up because I said
"Wow the people on Fox seem really rude, all they seem to do is make fun of people."
and boom I'm now a socialist which is synonymous with communist
even though I bitch about China constantly
still feeling bummed as hell that my brother finally got to come home and hang out for the first time since last christmas, and I hardly got to talk to him because dad wouldn't shut the fuck up about politics
I was drunk as fuck but was not having a good time, because I was either letting him ramble while rolling my eyes or trying to steer the conversation to different topics or less openly hostile things we could agree on to show that I don't just blindly accept things
Trumps hasn't been this disappointed since Eric was born.

I might have gotten myself banned from PC Part Picker because I queried for latency and pricing information at a rate of 100 requests per second, for over 14,000 requests.

Black Friday deals start today
That's not the issue man
I was given a list of good RAM that works well with my mobo + CPU combo.
Too bad it's made by Asus, and Asus is really just three monkeys in a trench coat, so the list only has basic information like speed and ID.
No latency information. No pricing information.

oh great he has *principles*
:kekpoint:

I kinda want to check out his content
is it good or is it zoomer as fuck
i didnt ask
but im amused
Aw man
how could you not ask
we were just talking at the dinner table and he disappeared to his room after dinner
didnt really have a chance
probably off to make some red hot tik tok thanksgiving memes
gotta stay on dat hustle
I hope he's doing alright otherwise tho
his parents, while nice enough, were always...well, they made the term "hover parent" seem lenient in comparison
anyone able to avail for some jacked box?
literally only stephan

unfortunately I'm pretty unavailable as I would have to be very quiet as I'm in florida and my parents are off to bed early

the new how it's actually made is amazing
Bruhhhhh I'm literally working a 12 hours shift and my entire day is gonna be gone.
So apparently, there's a theory that Gork and Mork are the two expelled Primarchs, who, when separated from the Emperor shortly after creation, were sent to Ork planets. They took on the attributes of their home worlds like all Primarchs did, and with their primarch psyker abilities were worshipped as God's. Primarch does sound close to Prime-ork if you say it with the Ork Cockney accent.
If the Space Wolves were sent to eliminate them like is assumed, they could have actually ascended to godhood if the Orks believed hard enough that they were actually gods.
that sounds dumb as hell, but plausible enough that I can't dispute it
40k in a nutshell really
MY PC ARRIVED
OWO
\\( '^')/
I can't wait to spend 6 hours re-downloading everything xD
I thought the Orks were around much much longer than the primarchs
also yay PC!
@ChuckRadaman pog
The Orks may have been around longer, but we don't necessarily know when they created Gork and Mork.

which would be sick AF
oof
Yup they're sending me the 1080
@Koala is this viable
I pinged you because you're the only one on
Hmmmm 50 bucks for a 500GB sounds about right
It says internal but that looks like an sad for laptops
Ssd
They just look like that plus it says it's a conversion kit so it jas some transfer stuff for transfering from an HDD it looks like
What's that WD Blue next to it
Theres 2 500gb and 1 1Tb
Of the WD Blue
I'd take the 1TB personally
$64 and $109
And I'd take the WD over the PNY
Ok
Will it come with the stuff to mount them?
Or would i need extra stuff?
Maybe? But hell you could just duct tape an SSD lol
Lmfao
Ok
They may or may not come with a 2.5" bracket to mount
:fiteme:
I think they typically do come with a mount
Nah these didny
Didn't
I bought all the WD's they had xD
And I added the cashier on steam xD
Lmao
Damn bruh
That's a lot of VR porn storage
Lmfao
Just a 2 tb total
You putting them all in your new pc or got other plans?
Probably gonna give kim one of the 500's
For WoW n stuff
uh
@Koala
how do i connect this to my pc
Brother.
Same things that you need to connect an HDD
Thats all that was in the box
SATA cable plus power
AAAAAAAAA FUCK
SATA cables typically come with your mobo
:getfucked:
bruh i thought this shit was plug n play
not fucking, "buy everything seperate and figure out how it fits"
:unlimitedthink:
dont you spinning thonk me xD
Perhaps you should have thought a little more lol
dude
i literally didn't know. I've never had to do anything to my PC before.
That's fair
You'll need SATA III data cables to go from the drive to the mobo, and SATA power cables to go from the drive to the PSU
@ChuckRadaman What happened to all those sata cables I bought you

It‚Äôll be so nice to have all my *visible* flaws fixed
Okay my lower teeth still look weird but whatever
Point is I won‚Äôt have big ass holes in them
Then one more trip to fix a few in betweens I didn‚Äôt know existed and I‚Äôm good
Still 30 minutes away
I got stabbed in the teeth in the spring and got two fillings

man trying to constantly keep things from dying is a christmas tradition I could do without
trying to maintain a shit ton of babies you never asked for is super emotionally draining, and I cannot hope to imagine how people with human babies handle this because then it's a legitimate problem in the eyes of society if you fail

Steam is refusing all refund requests for Cyberpunk if you have even as much as a minute over the 2 hour mark in game.
good news: headset came in even earlier than expected
bad news: the charger cable packed with it is just as short if not shorter than the spare I was using meaning using it while it's plugged up is a literal pain in the neck
;<
spare charging cables cost a bit too
does it not use the same kind of cable format? All of mine have had mini USB
yeah it's a mini usb, but all the cables I had on hand are short as fuck
and the actually long one from my last headset shorted out
oof
which was the main reason for buying a new headset, that and it wasn't holding a charge as well anymore and all the ear padding fell off, but I'm frugal and this model had a hella price jump for no reason
but I got it on sale for it's usual price from a few years back
so on the upside, I got a brand new version that fits snugly and is padded again
Is it a discontinued model?
it's a logitech HE2600 or something like that I think
H600?
that's it
