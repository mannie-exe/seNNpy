Ifen is home to the most dangerously religious zealots in the world. Ifeni scripture begins with their most beloved legend : when the All-mother departed from our world to become the Dreamwhisperer she left behind a promise : he conquers all would prove worthy enough for her to climb out of her dream palace and crown a new god and husband. This fable has many variants but is undeniably the foundation of Ifen culture. \n**Yten/ Yteni**\n    The oldest nation on Eoza by far. They say if you break earth anywhere in Yten eventually you\u2019ll find corpses from a long forgotten battle, and every home is built on top of some stranger\u2019s grave. Yteni government moves slowly, and the people adapt even more slowly. Though rich in population and tradition, Yteni inflexibility to technological and magical innovation has left them victims to frequent invasion.",

Stories say Ebreth settlers were rebels, banished from Yten long ago, and sealed away when an ancient Yteni ruler made a deal with Tautra, Keeper of Earth, to raise the Skyspear Mountains from the ground to separate the two nations. Life here is hard, but Ebrethi people thrive where they can.\n**Lorix / Lorixian**\n    Here, life is even harder. Lorix is a tiny nation on Eoza off the southern coast of Ifen, separated by a series of active volcanoes. Capital punishment isn\u2019t very popular and prisons are expensive to maintain so this sorry grouping of islands along with a bit of inhabitable pennuislla became the dumping ground of criminals from all over the world, as well as a hideaway for political refugees and practioners of illegal magic. One year a few centuries back Lorixians sent back the Ifen tribute ship empty handed and the Ifeni didn\u2019t bother doing anything about it -- there was hardly anything in Lorix worth taking. If you live in Lorix you must have pissed someone off and your life sucks, or you simply do not want to be found.",

Most of it is scorching desert but there is a swath of life that cuts through the center of it. Vanch people are tougher than their Eozan neighbors as a result of having to deal with harsher climate and more dangerous fauna, but there are far less of them. Rather than forming large cities, society here takes the form of fast changing allegiances between villages, families, and clans. Though when threatened as a collective the Vanch are willing to unite. \n**Apora / Apeche**\n    A mysterious continent only recently discovered. (if you choose to be from here you\u2019ll have to help me figure some stuff out). When lost sailors from Ifen stumbled upon unfamiliar, fungal forests they realized they weren\u2019t on the far jungle shore of Yten like they hoped, but someplace entirely different. Ifen being Ifen of course they immediately launched an invasion but were defeated by the natives using strange tactics and powerful magic. Curiously, the war was brought to an end when the Ifeni Prime Patriarch was made aware these natives weren\u2019t that different - they were dwarves, elves, humans, etc just like all the other nations. Even more curiously, they speak similar language, and worshipped the same goddess.",

It varies from place to place. Apora as an exemption has a majority of elves but otherwise experiences a large amount of race diversity.

Her title as Dreamwhisperer comes from the most consistent way people are able to commune with her, in their sleep. In Eoza priests and clerics travel from various organizations spreading her teachings based on historical scripture. In Vanash every tribe has a dreamer(a shaman dedicated to communing with the goddess), and every family prays for her blessing before taking a meal. Apeche methods of worship are mostly unknown but many have made their bodies into living tapestries, capturing fables and stories of the goddess onto their flesh. \n**Pagan Churches** \n    Though widespread, the dreaming goddess is not the only source of divine power in the world. Some pagans worship individuals from Dreamwhisperer legend as their true gods -- for example the Craftsman, her original husband, or a specific Realmkeeper, the guardians she left behind to maintain the world in their respective elements : earth, sea, and air. Others worship something totally unrelated ( like the god-emperor of mankind or some shit, I don\u2019t know. Fill in the blank god to worship, just work it out with me if you fiendin\u2019 for somethin particular.)",
